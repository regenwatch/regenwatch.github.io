        <h1>Case studies</h1>
        <p class="lead">124 interviews were conducted with households on 6 council estates across London. These interviews were carried out with current residents, as well as residents that had moved off the estate, and with some that moved off and then returned after regeneration. Interview questions focused on health and well-being and sought to understand how the regeneration of their estate impacted them. All estates had seen decanting, with residents describing households, friends and neighbours having moved off their estate. Interviewees across all estates raised concerns about affordability and the increase of market rate homes,the changing social character of the area, as well as a lack of clear information and poor management of the regeneration process.</p>

        <h2>Aylesbury estate</h2>
        <p class="lead">Key themes discussed in the interviews: 
	<ul class="lead">
		<li>Residents have experienced long term interference and disruption to services due to building works from the regeneration.</li>
		<li>Leaseholders express concern that will not be adequately compensated for their homes, meaning they therefore will be unable to afford homes on the estate or in the area after regeneration.</li>
		<li>There is a sense that South London as an area is experiencing gentrification pressure and that the area is likely to change for a different demographic of residents.</li>
		<li>It was often expressed that foreign investment drives the changes and this creates resentment.</li>
		<li>There is a fear for the future and shared opinion that the Council is intentionally displacing residents.</li>
		<li>The loss of the Heygate Estate and the displacement of its residents is referenced often and likely adds to these fears.</li></ul></p>

		<li>Aragon Tower (previously a council block, now privately owned) is a point of contention among residents and is frequently discussed as a loss of council homes on the estate.</li>
		<li>TIt is recognised by residents that the estate’s proximity to the River Thames is what makes it a desirable place to live, therefore adding to gentrification pressure with people moving to the area.</li>
		<li>In addition, the Convoys Wharf development is mentioned, this is adjacent to the estate and is under construction, and raises concerns among residents about its potential future impacts.</li></ul></p>
