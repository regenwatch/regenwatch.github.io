The Carpenters Estate was completed in 1970, providing 710 homes. Plans for its regeneration have been under consideration since 2000, with several buildings earmarked for demolition and the decanting of residents having started in 2005. The majority of council tenants have been moved out, it is mostly leaseholders and freeholders who remain. The estate holds several active pieces of legislation to ensure that the residents have control over their estate’s future, including the Carpenters Estate Residents’ Charter and the Greater Carpenters Neighbourhood Plan. In February 2020 the Council gave approval for Red Door Ventures to work with the residents on a development plan for the estate.

<p class="lead">Key themes discussed in the interviews:</p>
        <ul>
		<li>The estate’s residents describe its regeneration as having gone on for a long time with very little resolve in sight.</li>
		<li>Residents have been moved out and several buildings remain empty, creating a ‘ghost town’ and a feeling that the estate has been intentionally depopulated and degenerated to favour redevelopment.</li>
		<li>Whilst some residents have moved away, there has been a long term resistance to the estate’s regeneration. Keeping the community together is an important priority.</li>
		<li>The area is experiencing social change, the new-build homes that border the estate, in particular, are described as being for foreign investors not locals.</li>
		<li>The Olympic Games and the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, Westfield shopping centre, Stratford International and other train links, are all seen to be adding to gentrification pressures on the estate.</li></ul>

Because you don’t want to be spending money, and then next month we have to move out, so that’s on hold. It is like, it is just hanging up in the air, not knowing what is going to happen, and it has been like that since 2006."

Because one day, we were walking out, and I walked out that way, to the back, and that small block, it was all, it was almost like it was a ghost town. All of these boarded-up buildings, and I thought, this is, and I walked around, you saw more and more and it was like, where am I living? It’s just wasn’t the same place, and your heart sunk. Your heart just sunk it was like, this isn’t the Carpenters Estate anymore. But that is what they want you to feel."

Because, my plan was to, you know, I am a leaseholder, so, while I was working I purchased the flat, and slowly tried to pay it off. And then have this as my retirement flat, and live here. But all of that has been disturbed. And the process was quite bad, they were trying to knock at the door without any notification. They will just drop the card, saying ‘Can you contact us’? And people who spoke to them, they were kind of threatening as well. They were giving, saying to people that you indirectly, you know... trying to push them out."</p>
