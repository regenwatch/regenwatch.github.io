Completed in 1971, the estate is divided into Gascoigne East and Gascoigne West by a main road running through the middle of the estate. The original estate had 2,260 homes across both East and West, all of which are to be demolished. Planning application for the Gascoigne East was approved by the GLA in September 2015, planning for Gascoigne West was approved by the GLA Dec 2018. The first phase of East was completed in 2019, and full completion of Gascoigne East is due to be completed 2024. Work on phase 1 of Gascoigne West started with demolition in Jan 2020.

                "I was told in a letter that they were going to bring them down and they were going to build new homes for us to move into. This is what I was led to believe, but I didn’t know that those new ones are for sale, and for those who can afford to put down private rent, which I can’t. So, I’m losing my home, where I’ve just had a new kitchen put in and new bathroom, and I don’t know where I’m going to end up, and I’m worried because my husband’s [age] next year, and we don’t know. The only thing they’ve offered us is sheltered, like a sheltered flat for older people, but they are tiny, and I’ve got a lot of things and I don’t want to go into sheltered accommodation. That’s my worry, my right."

                "It was a rumour, because I was calling it, “Why are the blocks not down?” There’s no central heating. I’ve lived 15 years with no central heating, no double glazing. So, the winters are ridiculous. It’s just disgusting, and they didn’t care. They don’t care. As I said, the redevelopment is not for us, it’s not for poor people, it’s for people that are working, although I’m working, but it’s just for a whole different set of people."

              <p>"there was a lot of dissatisfaction from the families we know in our estate. They were saying, ‘Well, what else can we do?’ We’ve raised our awareness and problems in public hearing meetings by the Council, but the shift in the Council side isn’t much. The maximum is 10% or we just take what they give us. So, there isn’t much room to accommodate, and one of my neighbours he’s thinking about moving with his brothers that live in Birmingham, and this would be like good money to invest in a good-sized house for him. Another neighbours has moved out to Leicester. So, he found really good work there, but, again the shift that people are saying, ‘Well, what else can we do?'."</p>
