message: "There is a public right of way Footpath 37 that will be lost in the development\r\nThere are 1km of alleyways or Radburn lines that will be lost in the development. These are important for people and wildlife and are generally undisturbed.\r\nThere is a colony of 100-150 house sparrows which are a national priority species that will be impacted by the later stages of the development. House sparrows do not nest on tower blocks and even seed eating birds require insect food to feed their young.  Whih brings me onto trees-as 100 will be lost but some will die slowly as British Standards will not be followed as there is no space.\r\nThe area is an Area of Deficiency to open space and the mayor is pledged to reduce the numbers of households who lack access to credible areas of open space. Yet the pressure for putting residents into apartments for Phase 1 of the development (tring to avoid the decant word) means that even more open land including leisure services land will be developed in Norbiton."
