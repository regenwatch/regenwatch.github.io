  I used to look out for the red, blue and yellow blocks on my journey to Acton
  town on the Piccadilly Line. Having returned recently I notice only the yellow
  remains- the magnificent Jerome Tower. What were the names of the red and blue
  blocks and are there photos of them? Very sad for the residents. i'm lucky
  mine is only a fond memory, not the shocking sell-out of a Labour Mayor. oh
  dear. At least in Hammersmith and Fulham estates were saved.
