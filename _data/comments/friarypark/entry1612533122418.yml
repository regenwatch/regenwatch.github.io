message: "Re: Friary Park Estate, Acton, LONDON W3 \r\n\r\nDear Sir/Madam\r\nOn 20th December 2020 Catalyst Housing Group published plans to implement the demolition of 230 homes and destroy all the trees on the Friary Park Estate, Ref: 193424HYBRID, having obtained permission in November 2019. It is obvious the fencing Catalyst Housing Group contractors have erected threatens the lives of social housing tenants and their children.  Neither the London Borough of Ealing or Catalyst answer questions about Health and Safety.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday 21 Jan 2021 we wrote to London Fire Brigade about the obstruction of The Drive W3 caused by erecting fencing around part of the Friary Park estate leaving only an unlit narrow passage for the disabled, the elderly and young children living the 14 flats in Block D69 -82. The gate on Friary Road is locked with chain and padlock but Catalyst ground staff claim not to have a key.\r\n\r\nMartin Cain of 71 The Drive emailed around 10 AM and around 2 PM a fire engine reversed into Joseph Avenue which was empty of cars and vans. Firemen spent around 30 minutes chatting with 2 Catalyst staff employed to harass tenants and are responsible for making Black people homeless. I have no idea what this public display of conviviality was meant to achieve as everyone is well aware of the connivance of the London Fire Brigade with developers. \r\n\r\n2 firemen came to tell Mr Cain that they can link 3 hoses very fast implying there was no problem they could not handle. This only gives them 69 feet of hose running to the middle of Block JA. Given the fences this means that to evacuate the building firemen will take up a position that cuts off the unlit narrow passage, the only escape for the disabled, the elderly and young children from a fire. Frightened people would be forced to run straight into them. I see this a serious problem.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, all car owners are now forced to park on Sparks Cl/Joseph Ave. The spaces are all taken at night noticeably by commercial vehicles. The Fire Brigade manoeuvre on 21 January 2021 was pointless as there is no access to Joseph Avenue around 16 hours a day. When the demolition commences the heavy trucks removing rubble will all park up on Friary Road alongside Thames Water roadworks exasperating the problem of access.\r\n\r\nSince 2 January 2021 both Thames Water and the SSE have been digging up Friary Road and The Drive during the day. Everyday including the weekend.  Catalyst and LBE either ignore their social housing tenants or portray them as illiterate, Black benefits claimants. Mr Cain has lived there since 1989 and like all those opposed to having their homes demolished was prevented from attending the planning meeting by the racist Labour politician Daniel Crawford who continually portrays Black men as drug dealers while aiding white drug dealers. \r\n\r\nEaling Council Pollution department have responded and refuge collectors have emptied some of the dustbins contractors denied access to on Tuesday 20 January 2021. However as well as fires caused by domestic appliances there were the concerns raised with Ealing about the piles of dead wood, Catalyst having started to cut trees down and rip up bushes, have not been dealt with. And trees will be cut down all through the summer. \r\n\r\nI am aware Mount Avail and Catalyst have the insurance despite all the blocks having no insulation so flats cannot be sold at market value of £575,000 Catalysts put on them for leverage for IMES loans. I will report on this after I conduct a survey about access with the new parking arrangements introduced on 1 February 2021. \r\n\r\nI would like to know the cost of the August 2019 Home Fire Safety visit to the Friary Park estate to install fire alarms. I know former residents of the soon to be demolished flats in Friary Park Court took them but firemen reported a very low take up. How can I find out how many fire alarms LFB installed? It may be that people who watched the smoke from Grenfell Tower in their own homes perceive your policy of telling the disabled, the elderly and young children to stay indoors in the event of a fire as costing lives. \r\n\r\nI have photos of the fencing as it now stands as well as the unlit narrow passage Catalyst have left the elderly, the disabled and young children your system will not let me attach. \r\n\r\nAs you have been repeatedly told:\r\nNot only has a great deal been missed out, the authors present the lies of the Labour Party controlled planning department of the London Borough of Ealing and their partners Catalyst Housing Group in order to discriminate against social housing tenants with no regard for the uncertainty, depression and displacement common to tenants and leaseholders undergoing demolition. \r\n\r\nStarting with your misleading phrase \"community hall\" as Catalyst Housing Group have always denied tenants access, unless they were attending DWP assessments, as the premises are used as offices for Catalyst managers when not renting it out to the DWP in order to reduce disability payments to people in Acton. \r\n\r\nPlanning permission was granted on 20 November 2019 because Lucy Taylor, Ealing Council's Director of Regeneration excluded all social housing tenants from the planning meeting in order to ensure the racist Labour Councillor Daniel Crawford could lie that they wanted their homes demolished unchallenged. Neither have produced any evidence of this false claim. Furthermore the 77 page report prepared by Ealing Council omitted the Planning Contravention Notices Ealing Council has served on Catalyst Housing Group and the judgement by the Homes and Communities Agency against them for selling social housing to its managers. \r\n\r\nTelling the planning committee about the HCA judgement would have meant admitting Ealing Council had failed to recover value of these social housing assets from Catalyst Housing Group in accordance with the local government transparency Code 2015 Since 2018 councils and housing associations obtaining taxpayer funding to knock down and replace their existing stock should were required to provide evidence that the majority of residents supported for their homes being demolished through a ballot. Mount Anvil/Catalyst Housing Group and racists like Daniel Crawford made sure there was no ballot on the Friary Park estate and Mayor Khan has overlooked not only his own Estate Regeneration Guidance but also the relationship between Ealing Council's Lucy Taylor and Nick Taylor, the Greater London Assembly’s Director of Housing for North West London. This relationship explains why there is no stage 2 report on the GLA planning portal confirming the Mayor’s approval of the scheme. \r\n\r\nGiven the repeated racist claims by Labour councillor Daniel Crawford that Black Londoners wanted their homes demolished Ealing Council ensured they were not offered a meaningful alternative to demolition. Indeed since Crawford insists that all Black men are drug dealers Paul Najsarek Ealing Council's CEO has ensured all Black social housing tenants have been excluded from the Locata social housing allocation system. \r\n\r\nWhile Sadiq Khan’s stage 1 planning report confirms permission was granted for 990 flats going on sale for £350,000 the table provided fails to explain why Khan originally approved 560 flats but rather provides a link to https://www.chg.org.uk/development-regeneration/regeneration/friary-park-ealing/friary-park-rumour-busters/ which is full of lies. \r\n\r\nApart from the blatant racism of Crawford, Taylor and Najsarek the most blatant lie by theLabour Party is that Catalyst Housing Group is \"a charitable Housing Association that exists to provide low cost housing\". This is clearly disproved on Catalyst's own website that shows it is in the private rental business and provides extortionate Equity Loans for the properties they sell while using a dishonestly obtained tax status to avoid  paying tax on its huge profits. Charitable status allows this moneylender and private landlord to ensure that rather than \"Every pound we make selling homes is reinvested in meeting our commitment to provide low cost housing\" as the Labour Party claims Sarah Thomas, Chief Operating Officer of Catalyst Housing Group earns over £250,000 annually while former directors like Rod Cahill and trustees all still make over £200,000 a year. \r\n\r\nThere is no section 106 agreement about how many replacement social rented homes there will be or whether there will be any social rented tenure partly because former Catalyst Housing Group Director Tom Titherington repeatedly informed Ealing Council and the Greater London Assembly that all Friary Park residents are Black, illiterate benefits claimants, a deception Labour Councillors like Daniel Crawford and current Ealing Mayor Labour Councillor Abdullah Gulaid, currently profiting from Covid 19 by overcharging the NHS for products of his company Labcare Diagnostics, continue to lie about. \r\n\r\nThe other factor maybe the work being done on behalf of Mount Anvil to replace windows in all the flats on the Friary Park estate after 5 years have been spent getting permission to demolish them. Catalyst/Mount Anvil and Ealing Council still refuse to explain why they have stopped all Housing Benefit payments to all elderly and disabled tenants since February or answer questions related to the placemaking rumours that the developers simply want to remove single parents, the elderly and the disabled in order to replace them with those willing to take out Catalyst Equity Loans. With current rents of £124 per week and loan repayments for a 25% equity in a 1 bed room flat being £379 per week this a highly profitable option for a company with a long history of abusing the tax system."
