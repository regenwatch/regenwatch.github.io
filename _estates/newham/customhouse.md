A number of council estates were earmarked for redevelopment in Newham's [Custom House & Canning Town regeneration masterplan](https://www.newham.gov.uk/Documents/Environment%20and%20planning/CanningTownCustomHouseAdoptedSPD2008%5B1%5D.pdf), which set out 20 development sites.

The Canning Town side of the scheme is nearing completion but the Custom House estates are yet to be redeveloped. These are marked out on the South-west corner of the masterplan map below.
