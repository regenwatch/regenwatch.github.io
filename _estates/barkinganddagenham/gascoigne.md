In Dec 2018, the Mayor approved the demolition of 179 homes on the latest phase of the Gascoigne estate regeneration. The definition of 'London Affordable Rent' in the [planning consent](http://paplan.lbbd.gov.uk/online-applications/files/F07E42E8C4ADF9FDBF7F485D098282EA/pdf/17_00977_OUT-S106_AGREEMENT-272961.pdf) allows rents of up to 80% market rent.

These replacement 'affordable' homes have been funded by the Mayor and the estate was exempted by the Mayor from his requirement to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes.

Compulsory Purchase Orders have been issued and demolition is due to start in 2020.
