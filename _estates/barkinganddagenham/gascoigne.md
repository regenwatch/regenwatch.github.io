In Dec 2018, the Mayor approved the demolition of 179 homes on the latest phase of Barking & Dagenham's Gascoigne estate regeneration, to be replaced by 850 new homes of which 78 at 'London Affordabe Rent' (defined as up to 80% market rent). Leaseholders have the 'right to return'  only if they can afford to pay the rent in one of the new shared-ownership flats. 

The Mayor's [planning report](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/planning-applications-and-decisions/planning-application-search/gascoigne-estate-west) approves the demolition of 179 homes on this latest phase of the scheme, Gascoigne estate West - the [east side of the estate](/casestudies/gascoigne/) having been approved for demolition in September 2015.

This is despite the Mayor's own estate regeneration policy requiring no net loss of social rented housing. Indeed, the replacement 'social' housing is all 'London Affordable Rent' which is defined in the [planning consent's section 106 legal agreement](/images/gascoignes106.pdf) as up to 80% market rent.

These replacement 'affordable' homes have been funded by the Mayor and the estate was exempted by the Mayor from his requirement to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes.

Planning application [documents](/images/bdreside.pdf) confirm that tenants have been offered the 'right to return' to new homes on the estate, but acknowledge that (because the estate is being redeveloped by the Council's new [Housing Company](https://www.lbbd.gov.uk/affordable-rents-reside-housing)) the terms and rent levels of new tenancies would differ from those that tenants currently enjoy:

Compulsory Purchase Orders have been issued and demolition is due to start in 2020. Barking and Dagenham only offers an option of shared ownership for leaseholders who want to return to the estate.

This goes against the legal “principle of equivalence” which says that persons affected by compulsory purchase should be no worse off in financial terms after the acquisition. 

Similarly unfair policies were [deemed unlawful](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/16/government-blocks-controversial-plan-to-force-out-housing-estate-residents) by the Secretary of State at the 2015 Aylesbury estate CPO inquiry and required Southwark to [amend](http://moderngov.southwarksites.com/documents/s74901/Report%20Amending%20the%20shared%20equity%20rehousing%20policy%20for%20qualifying%20homeowners%20affected%20by%20regenerati.pdf) its policy.

The lack of a credible rehousing option on replacement homes for leaseholders is a breach of section 233(5&7) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, which requires that persons compulsorily removed from their homes for planning purposes are offered 'suitable accommodation' on the redeveloped land _'on terms settled with due regard to the price at which any such land has been acquired from him'_.
