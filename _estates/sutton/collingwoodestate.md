In 2013, the high-rise block on the estate was cladded with a light-blue ACU composite. In 2017, following the investigations as a result of the Grenfell disaster, it was [revealed](https://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/15372936.we-feel-so-unsafe-sutton-tower-block-residents-at-balaam-house-say-they-are-living-in-fear-after-grenfell-to/) that the cladding had failed safety tests.
