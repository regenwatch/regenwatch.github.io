The Chaucer estate is one of five estates listed in [Sutton's Local Plan (2018)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MdX6GlaHDoBdG6CTsvjFaIuPtIa9id5O/view) for potential redevelopment:

It is also earmarked in Sutton's [Policy Map](http://sutton.addresscafe.com/app/exploreit/) as a potential renewal area:

In 2013, the high-rise block on the estate was cladded with a light-blue ACU composite. Two years later, after the investigations following the Grenfell disaster, it was [revealed](https://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/15387026.sutton-housing-partnership-sutton-council-and-sutton-fire-commander-meet-concerned-residents-living-in-chaucer-house-sutton/) that the cladding had failed safety tests.
