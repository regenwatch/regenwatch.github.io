288 homes are earmarked for demolition on Wandsworth Alton estate in Roehampton.

In 2017 Wandsworth signed a joint venture agreement with developer Redrow for the redevelopment of parts of the estate.

A planning application for the redevelopment was submitted by Redrow in June 2019 which would see the demolition of 288 homes and construction of 1,108 new homes.

The Mayor raised objections to the planning application, which resulted in Redrow revising its plans and submitting a revised application in May 2020.
