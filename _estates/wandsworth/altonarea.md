288 homes are earmarked for demolition on Wandsworth's Alton estate in Roehampton.

Wandsworth [claims](https://www.wandsworth.gov.uk/media/1627/roehampton_adopted_spd_oct_2015.pdf) that demolition is necessary because the design of the buildings is poor and encourages anti-social behaviour.

In 2017, Wandsworth signed a joint venture agreement with developer Redrow for the redevelopment of the estate.

Despite the existing estate comprising an almost even split of social rented and private homes (leaseholders and freeholders), it is [claimed](https://planning2.wandsworth.gov.uk/iam/IAMCache/5300271/5300271.pdf) that _"the limited diversity in housing tenures and high proportion of social housing has inhibited the creation of a genuinely mixed and balanced community"_.

A planning application for the redevelopment was submitted by Redrow in June 2019 for the demolition of 288 homes and construction of 1,108 new homes.

The Mayor [raised objections](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/public%3A//public%3A//PAWS/media_id_471293///alton_estate_report.pdf) to the planning application, which promised to make only 53 of the additional new homes affordable, with 30 for social rent and 23 for shared ownership. The Mayor said it was “unacceptable” that the affordable housing proposed was _“segregated in single tenure blocks on the periphery of the site”_, meaning the application did not comply with the London Plan.

The Mayor's [report](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/public%3A//public%3A//PAWS/media_id_471293///alton_estate_report.pdf) also concluded that although the 158 existing social rent homes set to be demolished would be re-provided, they would not be “like-for-like” replacements in terms of floorspace.

The Mayor also required Redrow _'to model the impact of GLA grant funding'_ as there has been no application for Mayoral grant funding to date.

The Mayor's requirement to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes is linked to grant funding, such that if Redrow doesn't apply for grant funding then it isn't obliged to hold a ballot.

Redrow submitted a revised planning application in May 2020, which claimed to address the issues raised by the Mayor. The revised application proposed a total of 1,108 homes of which 261 affordable (201 social rent).

In August 2020, Redrow announced that it was withdrawing from the scheme and terminating its partnership with Wandsworth Council.
