Outline permission granted in 2015 for 766 replacement homes, with just 35% affordable of which 70% affordable rent. The estate is being redeveloped in a joint venture between Greenwich Council and developer [Lovell](https://www.lovell.co.uk/)

The Mayors [report](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/public%3A//public%3A//PAWS/media_id_251858///one_woolwich_morris_walk_report.pdf) approving the application acknowledges that there will be a net loss of 333 social rented units.

It also acknowledges that the replacement 'social' housing will be 'affordable rent' in tenure - i.e. up to 80% market rents.

Despite being granted outline planning in 2015, detailed applications for the scheme are still pending and the estate is still largely occupied.

If leaseholders want to take up a new home on the redeveloped estate they will have to do so under a shared-ownership agreement - ie. paying rent on the unowned proportion. 

In July 2019, Greenwich approved a decision to start compulsory purchase proceedings against the remaining leaseholders on the estate. As at June 2020 the CPO proceedings had not yet commenced.
