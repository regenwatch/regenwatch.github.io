42 homes have been earmarked for demolition by Lambeth Council at Denby Court in Kennington.

Lambeth proposes to demolish this former sheltered housing block, which is currently being used as "temporary" accommodation for families on its housing waiting list.

The site also contains a former education facility, which will also be demolished as part of the scheme. Lambeth proposes to build 144 new homes on the site of which it says 50% will be affordable, of which 70% will be 'council level rent' and 30% shared ownership.

There is no planning application yet as the scheme has only recently entered consultation stage, with draft proposals exhibited for online consultation here: [https://denbycourt.communityuk.live/overview](https://denbycourt.communityuk.live/overview)
