135 homes are earmarked for demolition on Lambeth's Geoffrey Close estate near Coldharbour Lane.

Housing association Riverside Homes, which manages the estate, [wants to replace it](https://www.riverside.org.uk/redevelopment-projects/lambeth-estate-revitalising-your-neighbourhood/about-the-redevelopment-of-the-lambeth-estate/) with 400 new homes, 135 of which at London Affordable Rent.

In December 2018, 67% of residents who voted in the ballot voted in favour of redevelopment. The scheme is being [funded](/approved/funding) by the Mayor in a joint venture between Riverside and Bellway Homes.

Consultation is underway ahead of the proposed submission of a planning application in late 2020.
