864 homes are earmarked for demolition on Lambeth's Clapham Park estate.

Lambeth Borough Council transferred the estate housing stock to Metropolitan over a decade ago. To date, more than 500 homes have been built and 700 refurbished under the original 2008 masterplan.

In 2018 Metropolitan applied to extend the scheme to include demolition of futher buildings in a revised masterplan.
