All low-rise maisonette blocks on the Westbury estate have been earmarked for demolition as part of Lambeth's ongoing estate renewal programme.

Planning permission was granted in July 2019 for the demolition of 82 homes comprising all of the estate's low-rise blocks and their replacement with 270 new homes of which 38% 'affordable' of which 48 social rent.

The Mayor's [report](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/public%3A//public%3A//PAWS/media_id_469670///westbury_estate_report.pdf) approving the planning permission explains that the scheme couldn't meet his 50% minimum affordable housing requirement because only 38% is viable.
