A [Dec 2019 Cabinet report](http://democracy.brent.gov.uk/documents/s92415/09.%20Cabinet%20Report_Future%20St%20Raphaels%20Masterplanning_Final%2026%2011%2019.pdf) agrees that only Area A of the estate (793 homes) be progressed for redevelopment. 522 of these homes are council owned, the remainder are split evenly between freeholders and leaseholders.

Within the estate is a church (St Patrick's Roman Catholic Church) and a Tenants & Residents Association Hall (Henderson Hall).

In 2018 Brent Council conducted an [options appraisal](http://democracy.brent.gov.uk/documents/s74722/07.%20St%20Raphaels%20Estate%20Cabinet%20Report.pdf) which confirmed that _"a stock condition survey was undertaken during August and September 2018. The findings of the survey reveal the properties to be in a reasonable state of repair (para 3.5)."_ It went on to conclude that the poor design of the estate was is the cause of ongoing crime and anti-social behaviour issues:

A ballot is expected to be held in Autumn 2020, with two options for residents to choose from; infill or comprehensive redevelopment. Brent Council's FAQ document distributed to residents makes it clear that if infill is the preferred option then the estate may not receive any investment for improving current housing conditions:

## Rehousing offer
The small print in Brent's [rehousing offer](http://democracy.brent.gov.uk/documents/s60550/Improving%20the%20Housing%20Offer%20for%20Tenants%20and%20Leaseholders.pdf) to leaseholders fails to provide a credible right of return to leaseholders on the redeveloped estate.

Brent requires leaseholders to be able to affor a minimum 50% share in a shared equity home on the redeveloped estate, as well as requiring them to contribute their personal savings (paras 5.8.2 and 5.8.3). This was ruled unlawful by the Secretary of State following the 2016 Aylesbury estate public inquiry, where Southwark had to revise its policy to require a 25% minimum share without savings contributions and with several other concessions i.e. - succession rights, proportioned service charge payments, stamp duty etc.
