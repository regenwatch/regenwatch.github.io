793 homes on the St Raphael's estate have been earmarked for potential demolition. [This Dec 2019 Cabinet report](http://democracy.brent.gov.uk/documents/s92415/09.%20Cabinet%20Report_Future%20St%20Raphaels%20Masterplanning_Final%2026%2011%2019.pdf) confirms that 522 of these are council owned, the remainder are split evenly between freeholders and leaseholders.

This extract from a [2018 options appraisal](http://democracy.brent.gov.uk/documents/s74722/07.%20St%20Raphaels%20Estate%20Cabinet%20Report.pdf) the estate is home to predominantly BAME communities:

Within the estate is a church (St Patrick's Roman Catholic Church) and a Tenants & Residents Association Hall (Henderson Hall).

In 2018 Brent Council conducted an [options appraisal](http://democracy.brent.gov.uk/documents/s74722/07.%20St%20Raphaels%20Estate%20Cabinet%20Report.pdf) which confirmed that _"a stock condition survey was undertaken during August and September 2018. The findings of the survey reveal the properties to be in a reasonable state of repair (para 3.5)."_ It went on to conclude that the poor design of the estate was is the cause of ongoing crime and anti-social behaviour issues:

The [Dec 2019 Cabinet report](http://democracy.brent.gov.uk/documents/s92415/09.%20Cabinet%20Report_Future%20St%20Raphaels%20Masterplanning_Final%2026%2011%2019.pdf) acknowledges that the schemes is currently unviable and that if it proceeds using current day values there will be a £22m viability gap. This means that Brent would receive no payment for the land and would end up paying £22m to subsidise the transfer of the land into private ownership. There has been no impact assessment of the affect that this will have on Brent Council's finances and its general responsibilities as a public service provider.

## Ballot

A ballot is expected to be held in Autumn 2020, with two options for residents to choose from; infill or comprehensive redevelopment. Brent Council's FAQ document distributed to residents makes it clear that if infill is the preferred option then the estate may not receive any investment for improving current housing conditions:

## Rehousing offer
The small print in Brent's [rehousing offer](http://democracy.brent.gov.uk/documents/s60550/Improving%20the%20Housing%20Offer%20for%20Tenants%20and%20Leaseholders.pdf) to leaseholders fails to provide a credible right of return to leaseholders on the redeveloped estate.

Brent requires leaseholders to be able to affor a minimum 50% share in a shared equity home on the redeveloped estate, as well as requiring them to contribute their personal savings (paras 5.8.2 and 5.8.3). This was ruled unlawful by the Secretary of State following the 2016 Aylesbury estate public inquiry, where Southwark had to revise its policy to require a 25% minimum share without savings contributions and with several other concessions i.e. - succession rights, proportioned service charge payments, stamp duty etc. See [here](https://regenwatch.github.io/guide/#leaseholders) for more information on leaseholders' rights.
