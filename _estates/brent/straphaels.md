The [2018 options appraisal](http://democracy.brent.gov.uk/documents/s74722/07.%20St%20Raphaels%20Estate%20Cabinet%20Report.pdf) describes the St. Raphael's estate in Neasden as a large estate with 1174 homes comprising Area A (793 homes) built in the late seventies and areas B & C which are older properties. It is located beside the river Brent.

Paragraph 3.5 of the 2018 options appraisal confirms that _"A stock condition survey was undertaken during August and September 2018. The findings of the survey reveal the properties to be in a reasonable state of repair."_ It then goes on to repeat all of the common tropes abou the design of the estate being the cause of crime and anti-social behaviour:

A [Dec 2019 Cabinet report](http://democracy.brent.gov.uk/documents/s92415/09.%20Cabinet%20Report_Future%20St%20Raphaels%20Masterplanning_Final%2026%2011%2019.pdf) agrees that only Area A of the estate (793 homes) be progressed for redevelopment. 522 of these homes are council owned, the remainder are split evenly between freeholders and leaseholders.
