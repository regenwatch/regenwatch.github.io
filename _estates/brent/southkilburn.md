The South Kilburn estate has been undergoing redevelopment for some years. The current proposals are based on the [2017 Masterplan](https://www.brent.gov.uk/your-community/regeneration/south-kilburn-regeneration/the-development-process/masterplan-and-programme?tab=southkilburnsupplementaryplanningdocument2017). 

As of July 2019 there remain 17 blocks in the second half of the scheme earmarked for demolition, but this phase is yet to be approved for planning permission  - see [this Cabinet report](http://democracy.brent.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=455&MId=5355&Ver=4), item 7. A ballot of residents returned a positive result [in Oct 2019](https://www.kilburntimes.co.uk/news/south-kilburn-votes-yes-1-6331125).
