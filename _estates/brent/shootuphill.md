Brent's cabinet signed off a co-operational agreement with Network Homes on March 9 2020, which will allow the two bodies to share knowledge to improve the borough's housing sector through regeneration schemes.

Three of the schemes are [listed](http://democracy.brent.gov.uk/documents/s95738/07.%20Cabinet%20Report%20-%20Collaboration%20with%20Network%20Homes.pdf) (para 4.4.3) as 'Claire Court, Watling Gardens and Windmill Court' on the Shoot Up Hill estate. 

It is unclear from this report exactly which blocks have been earmarked for demolition.
