The Teviot estate was transferred in a stock transfer to [Poplar HARCA housing association](https://www.poplarharca.co.uk/), which [completed](http://democracy.towerhamlets.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=10064) in 2007.

The estate borders the Limehouse Cut canal to the North, the River Lea to the East and Langdon Park and Balfron Tower to the South. Poplar HARCA have already come under [criticism](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/sep/19/balfron-20-how-goldfingers-utopian-tower-became-luxury-flats) for its privatisation of Balfron Tower.

The scheme is part of Poplar HARCA's ‘Poplar Reshaping’ masterplan which envisages the redevelopment of ten estates: Aberfeldy, Brownfield, Bow Bridge, Coventry Cross, Burdett, Devons, Lansbury, Leopold, Lincoln and Teviot.

Ballot approved

In December 2018, residents were [told](/images/teviotDec2018.pdf) that if they chose refurbishment then they would have to have new homes built above them in order to pay for the refurbishment.

In March 2019, residents were [informed](/images/teviotMarch2019.pdf) that their steering group had requested the refurbishment option to be taken off the table.

This is a clear breach of the Mayor's guidance on ballots which says...

[Rehousing offer](/images/teviotoffer.pdf) is more generous than most (with the exception of Merton). It allows a certain amount of the equity loan to be written off after 7 years. This is in line with the [government's guidance]..
