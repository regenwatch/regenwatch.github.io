Ashington House on the Collingwood estate in Bethnal Green is earmarked for potential redevelopment in [this Sep 2019 Cabinet report](https://democracy.towerhamlets.gov.uk/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=155455).

Paragraph 4.5 of the report states that the building is _'considered no longer fit for purpose'_ according to a [2018 stock condition survey](https://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/Documents/Ridge_Ashington_House_Report.pdf).
