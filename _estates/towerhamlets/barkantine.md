One Housing Group currently manages 2,027 homes across the Samuda, St Johns, Barkantine and Kingsbridge estates, but proposals under Project Stone will see the demolition of all four and their replacement with 8,906 new homes.

In 2014 OHG produced a [52 page report ‘Project Stone’](/images/ProjectStone.pdf) setting out proposals to replace all 2,027 homes with up to 10,000 properties

    Barkantine estate - 769 homes demolished and replaced with up to 3,467 new properties.
    St John’s estate – demolishing 607 homes and replacing with up to 2,809 new properties
    Samuda estate – demolishing 517 homes and replacing with up to 2,213 new properties
    Kingsbridge estate – demolishing 134 homes and replacing with up to 417 new properties

If Project Stone goes ahead, just 30% of the redeveloped properties will be available for affordable housing. Of those, 17% would be shared ownership and 13% would be rented.

The four estates originally belonged to Tower Hamlets Council as part of its housing stock, but were taken over by Toynbee Island Homes in 2005. Two years later, a merger with Community Housing Association led to the creation of One Housing Group.
