The scheme is being [funded](/approved/funding) by the Mayor and [exempted](/approved/ballotexemptions) from his requirement to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes.

The Mayor's [planning report](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/public%3A//public%3A//PAWS/media_id_460890///chrisp_street_market_report.pdf) approving the scheme confirms that the redeveloped site will provide 643 new homes of which 36% will be 'affordable'. None of the affordable homes will be social rent but 131 homes will be London Affordable Rent.
