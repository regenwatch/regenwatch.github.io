In September 2011, Lewisham Council agreed to redevelop the 276 council homes in Milford Towers along with the Catford Shopping centre (which it sits above) as part of its regeneration plans for Catford Town Centre. 

Following the decant of most of the secure tenants the scheme stalled and in 2013 Lewisham signed an agreement with Notting Hill Genesis Housing Association to let the homes out at intermediate rents.

In 2018, further delays saw the Council [extend its agreement with Notting Hill](http://councilmeetings.lewisham.gov.uk/documents/s58205/Secretary%20of%20State%20Approval%20Milford%20Towers.pdf) until 2024. At that point in time there were 17 remaining secure tenants, 18 leaseholders, 49 temporary tenants and 191 homes let to Notting Hill.
