Circa 300 homes on the Chingford Hall estate have been earmarked for renewal, according to the borough's [draft Local Plan](https://walthamforest.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Final%20Draft%20Local%20Plan_July2019_Web%20optimised_Part1.pdf).

The estate dates from the early 90s when it replaced the now-demolished [60s Chingford Hall estate](http://www.towerblock.eca.ed.ac.uk/development/chingford-hall-stage-ii) as one of the government's [Housing Action Trust](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/this-is-a-council-estate-the-government-spent-pounds-150000-on-each-house-why-1322746.html) regeneration schemes. The Waltham Forest Housing Action Trust closed down in 2002 and the homes were [transferred](https://www.peabody.org.uk/neighbourhoods/waltham-forest/chingford/about) to housing association Peabody.
