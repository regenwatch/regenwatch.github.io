The Chingford Hall estate has been earmarked for renewal, according to the borough's [draft Local Plan](https://walthamforest.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Final%20Draft%20Local%20Plan_July2019_Web%20optimised_Part1.pdf).

The estate dates from the early 90s when it replaced the now-demolished [60s Chingford Hall estate](http://www.towerblock.eca.ed.ac.uk/development/chingford-hall-stage-ii).
