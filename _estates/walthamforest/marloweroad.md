Circa 150 homes remain earmarked for demolition on Waltham Forest's Marlowe Road estate in Walthamstow.

The estate was one of 11 estates [identified](https://democracy.walthamforest.gov.uk/documents/s10654/4.2.%20LSP%20report%20-%20Estates%20Review.pdf) for possible redevelopment in a 2010 Estates Capacity Study.

The scheme is being progressed in a joint venture with developer Countryside properties. Phase one of the scheme is approaching completion while the remainder of the estate remains fully occupied.

The redevelopment is being [funded](/approved/funding) by the Mayor and has been granted an [exemption](/approved/ballotrequirements) from his requirement to ballot residents.
