In January 2020, Hounslow's Cabinet [agreed a comprehensive review](https://democraticservices.hounslow.gov.uk/documents/s157644/CEX432%20Housing%20Estate%20Regeneration%20Programme.pdf) of its 171 council estates with a view to infill or redevelopment.

In the [Cabinet report](https://democraticservices.hounslow.gov.uk/documents/s157644/CEX432%20Housing%20Estate%20Regeneration%20Programme.pdf) it was agreed that six estates had already been identified as 'poor performing estates'. 

Brabazon estate, Heston.
Brookwood estate, Hounslow.
Charlton House, Brentford.
Convent Way estate, Heston.
Norman Crescent estate, Heston.
Oriel estate, Feltham.

The Convent Way estate was identified as the best of these 'poor performing estates' that would benefit from early regeneration.

The Convent Way Estate was originally built in 1967. It comprises of one 12 storytower block, 16 medium rise (3 to 5 storey) blocks. In total the estate comprises 440 homes. In addition, the estate contains a health centre, community centre, and a small shopping parade.

Paragraph 3.4.2 of the Council's [2020 Cabinet report](https://democraticservices.hounslow.gov.uk/documents/s157644/CEX432%20Housing%20Estate%20Regeneration%20Programme.pdf) explains that the estate needs to be redevoloped because its homes typically have an energy efficiency rating of D when the Council's required standard is C. 

The estate also supposedly _"generates low levels of tenant satisfaction, which is borne out, by high levels of complaints from residents, including for repairs and ASB. The estaterepresents 2.6% of our total stock yet generated 7% of all housing complaintsin 2018/19;  ï‚·is prone to persistent high levels of fly-tipping and traveller incursions."_
