249 homes are under threat of demolition by Guinness housing association on the Mansell Street estate in the City of London.

The estate is listed as a 'Key Area of Change' in the local plan: [https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/services/environment-and-planning/planning/planning-policy/local-plan/Documents/draft-city-plan-2036.pdf](https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/services/environment-and-planning/planning/planning-policy/local-plan/Documents/draft-city-plan-2036.pdf)

In June 2019, it was [reported](https://www.citymatters.london/mansell-street-estate-residents-must-final-say/) that the stalled previous plans were currently being reworked before being presented to residents once again.
