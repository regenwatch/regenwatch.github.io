The Sky City estate comprises circa 150 council homes above Wood Green mall. The mall and estate have been listed as a development site and designated for comprehensive redevelopment in the Council's [Local Plan site allocations DPD](https://www.haringey.gov.uk/sites/haringeygovuk/files/final_haringey_site_allocations_dtp_online.pdf) (site SA9) and [Wood Green Area Action Plan](https://www.haringey.gov.uk/sites/haringeygovuk/files/nsr00284-wood_green_aap_2018_awv4_lr.pdf).

In October 2018, Haringey's Cabinet member for Regeneration said that the Council intends to remove the Page High estate in a revised version of the Area Action Plan to be consulted upon in early 2019. This revised version is yet to be published or consulted upon.
