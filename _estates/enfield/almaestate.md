In 2015, Enfield's Cabinet [agreed](https://governance.enfield.gov.uk/documents/g9278/Public%20reports%20pack%2018th-Nov-2015%2020.15%20Cabinet.pdf?T=10) to consider charging affordable rent for new council homes built as part of its estate renewals, albeit not necessarily at the full 80% of market rent.

In October 2015, the Council's Cabinet agreed an Estate Renewal Programme (2016-2025) setting out its plans for redeveloping a number of its council estates (item 24):
