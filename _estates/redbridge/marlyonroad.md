Redbridge Council is just about to start its decant of the Marlyon road estate, where 36 homes have been earmarked for demolition in a joint venture with Engie Regeneration Ltd. 

The latest [November 2019 newsletter](https://www.redbridge.gov.uk/media/7409/marlyon-road-newsletter-november-2019.pdf) gives further details of the scheme - and describes the replacement homes as 'affordable rent' tenure (i.e. up to 80% market rent).
