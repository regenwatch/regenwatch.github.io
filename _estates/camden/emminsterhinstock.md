Phase 3 of Camden's [Abbey Road estate regeneration](https://www.camden.gov.uk/abbey-road-development) envisages the demolition of two of the estate's blocks - Emminster and Hinstock. It will also involve the demolition of the Abbey Community Centre, Belsize Priory Health Centre, the parade of shops and the Lillie Langtry pub.
