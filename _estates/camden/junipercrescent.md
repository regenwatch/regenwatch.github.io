circa 200 homes on Juniper Crescent and Gilbey's yard estates are earmarked for redevelopment as part of the [Camden Goods Yard regeneration](https://www.camden.gov.uk/documents/20142/145786127/Site+Allocations+2020+-+05+Camden+Goods+Yard.pdf)

A ballot was supposed to be held by housing association One Housing Group in late March 2020, but this was [postponed](https://onehousing.co.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/16319/Juniper-Crescent-and-Gilbeys-Yard-project-FAQs-2020.pdf) because of the coronavirus crisis.
