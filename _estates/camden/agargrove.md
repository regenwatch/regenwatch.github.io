The Agar Grove estate is situated east of Camden Town and north of Kings Cross and comprises 249 homes in circa 10 blocks of low-rise maisonettes and an 18 storey high-rise block (Lulworth House - which will be refurbished as part of the plans). 

The scheme has been exempted by the Mayor from his requirement to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes. 

Planning consent for redevelopment was granted in Dec 2014 which spans six phases of development. The first phase in currently underway and Camden has already started marketing the new private homes on this phase [https://thecamdencollection.co.uk/](https://thecamdencollection.co.uk/):

In 2019, Camden Council issued a Compulsory Purchase Order in order to remove the remaining leaseholders in the next phase. The Council's [statement of reasons](https://www.camden.gov.uk/documents/20142/35497697/Agar+Grove+estate+CPO+-+Statement+of+Reasons+May+2019.pdf/5dc5fe4d-8a00-07db-2e4e-d4984251e7d7) for redeveloping the estate gives the following explanation of why demolition is necessary:

It also explains that only 216 replacement social rented homes will replace the 249 being demolished (para 3.10). Paragraph 3.15 of the CPO statement reveals that Camden's shared equity offer to leaseholders requires them to take out a mortgage if they want to take up the offer of a new home (on top of any existing mortgage).

The Compulsory Purchase Order for phase two was confirmed and became effective in April 2020.

There is no publicly available section 106 agreement so it is impossible to confirm whether the replacement social housing will be provided as social rent or affordable rent (up to 80% market rent) and whether they will remain so in perpetuity.
