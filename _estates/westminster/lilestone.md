The Lilestone estate is [located](https://lbhf.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=7cab3cdf6e344a0fb24df59ed6b9bdc5) in a __Housing Renewal__ zone in Westminster's emerging 2019-2040 Local Plan.

It is also within the boundary of the __Edgeware Road Housing Zone__, one of [30 special housing zones](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/housing-and-land/increasing-housing-supply/housing-zones#acc-i-42741) designated by the Mayor to deliver accelerated housing development. The Edgeware Road zone is expected to deliver 1700 new homes.

The redevelopment of the estate has not been specifically included in the [current masterplan](https://committees.westminster.gov.uk/documents/s24437/Church_Street_masterplan__boards.pdf) but this does envisage bringing such further sites forward within the next 15-20 years.
