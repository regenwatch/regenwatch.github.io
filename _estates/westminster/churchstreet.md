Circa 200 homes on Westminster's Church Street area estate are under threat of potential demolition.

Church street estate is located in Maida Vale, situated beside the Regent's Canal and in close proximity of Regent's Park.
It is also [located](https://lbhf.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=7cab3cdf6e344a0fb24df59ed6b9bdc5) within an area that has been designated a __Housing Renewal__ zone in Westminster's [draft 2019-2040 Local Plan](https://www.westminster.gov.uk/cityplan2040).

It is also within the boundary of the __Edgeware Road Housing Zone__, one of [30 special housing zones](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/housing-and-land/increasing-housing-supply/housing-zones#acc-i-42741) designated by the Mayor to deliver accelerated housing development. The Edgeware Road zone is expected to deliver 1700 new homes.

Some blocks on the estate were specifically earmarked for demolition in the 2012 Masterplan, although the [current masterplan](https://committees.westminster.gov.uk/documents/s24437/Church_Street_masterplan__boards.pdf) does envisage including further blocks for demolition over the next 15-20 years.
