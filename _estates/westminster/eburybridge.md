Demolition is well underway of the 336 homes earmarked for demolition on Westminster's Ebury Bridge estate in Pimlico. Westminster has taken the [controversial decision](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/westminster-city-council-accused-of-trying-to-dodge-scrutiny-over-estate-regeneration-63267) of decanting and demolishing the estate without first seeking planning permission or balloting residents.

Westminster Council's intention to regenerate the estate started in 2010, when the estate was first identified in the Council's Housing Renewal Strategy as one of five key estates within the borough in need of significant investment.

Plans were submitted in 2014 [(ref:14/01295/COFUL)](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/public%3A//public%3A//PAWS/media_id_255164///ebury_bridge_estate_report.pdf) which were subsequently approved in 2016. These proposals were found to be unviable and remained unimplemented until they subsequently expired in 2019.

The 2014 plans envisaged the retention of four of the estates grey brick blocks.A fresh planning application was submitted in July 2020 which now includes the retention of just one of these blocks. The plans seek to demolish a total of 336 homes (198 social rent, 138 council leasehold) and replace them with 758 new homes, of which 50% affordable - of which 300 social rent and 86 intermediate.
