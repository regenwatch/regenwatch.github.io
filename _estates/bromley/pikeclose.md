In 2018, Riverside Housing Association (which manages Bromley's council housing), appointed developer Countryside Properties to redevelop the Pike Close estate. The estate comprises circa 100 homes in a series of low-rise maisonettes and a high-rise block.

The Mayor agreed funding in principle for the redevelopment in December 2018 (subject to ballot). In April 2019, a ballot was held and a majority of residents voted in favour of redevelopment. A planning application was due to be submitted in Autumn 2019 but as of June 2020 no application has been submitted.
