271 homes are earmarked for demolition on Barnet's Douglas Bader Park estate in Colindale - a planning application is expected to be submitted in Autumn 2020.

The estate is under the management of housing association [Home Group](http://homegroup.org.uk) and housebuilder [Hill Group](http://hill.co.uk).

In May 2019, residents were balloted on the redevelopment options for the estate, but were [told](/images/DouglasBaderParkBallot.pdf) that if they voted against full redevelopment then only essential repairs would be carried out on their homes:

This is slowly [becoming standard practice](/approved/ballotexemptions/) in the ballot process - residents are faced with the choice of redevelopment or continued neglect and disinvestment; the option of having their homes refurbished is simply not on the table.
