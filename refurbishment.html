		           <h1>Making the case for refurbishment</h1>
			         <p class="lead text-muted" align="left">
Research has shown that refurbishment of council estates is nearly always the best option when taking into account social and environtmental factors. Refurbishment can deliver significant improvements in energy, environmental and health performance, which can lead to costs savings and improved living standards for residents. It can have lower overall lifetime costs than redevelopment and can cause less disruption to communities.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Demolition <span class="text-muted">- doubly wasteful.</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">The construction industry produces no less than 35-40 per cent of the UKâ€™s total carbon emissions and 35 per cent of materials desposited as waste. Refurbishment avoids this waste and conserves the emissions embodied in the construction materials, the building process, as well as emissions produced from demolition. </p>

	<p class="lead">University College London has produced a <href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/engineering-exchange/sites/engineering-exchange/files/report-refurbishment-demolition-social-housing_1.pdf">detailed report</a> outlining the merits of refurbishment versus demolition. The Mayor's new <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/better-homes-for-local-people-the-mayors-good-practice-guide-to-estate-regeneration.pdf">Estate Regeneration Guidance</a> says that demolition should only be considered as a last resort and he recently introduced new <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/implementing-london-plan/planning-guidance/circular-economy-statement-guidance-pre-consultation-draft">Circular Economy Guidance.</a> <a href="/images/genslerheygate.pdf">Case studies</a> have been supported by a <a href="https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/introducing-retrofirst-a-new-aj-campaign-championing-reuse-in-the-built-environment/10044359.article">'retrofit' campaign</a> led by the Architects' Journal.</a></p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Economically <span class="text-muted">- the business case.</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">Option appraisals often fail to take a number of crucial factors into account:
	<ul>
		<li>The financial cost of decanting the estate including buy-out costs of leaseholders.</li>
		<li>The loss of rental income for the Council both in the short term and long term.</li>
	        <li>Increased temporary accommodation costs as a result of decanting tenants into existing stock.</li>
	</ul>
	Our <a href="/images/residentscharter_template.docx">template Residents' Charter</a> sets out detailed requirements ensuring that theseconsiderations as well as environmental factors are taken into account from the outset.
