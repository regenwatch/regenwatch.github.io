I"	<p>476 homes are earmarked for demolition on Lambeth’s Central Hill estate.</p>

<p>Central Hill is the largest of Lambeth’s <a href="/underthreat/lambeth">five estates</a> earmarked for demolition.</p>

<p>It was first earmarked for potential redevelopment in a <a href="https://moderngov.lambeth.gov.uk/documents/s70441/03_Lambeth%20Estate%20Regeneration%20and%20Housing%20Delivery%20-%20December%202014%20v3%20docx.pdf">December 2014 Cabinet decision</a>.</p>

<p>Lambeth <a href="https://moderngov.lambeth.gov.uk/documents/s87425/Cabinet%20Report%20-%20Central%20Hill%20-%20March%202017%20-%20final%20clean%204%20RD.pdf">says</a> that it is demolishing the estate because the cost of refurbishing the existing homes is £44,000 per dwelling when its average cost for other estates is only £16,000 and that the Council simply doesn’t have the £18.5m required.</p>

<p>In 2019, an <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/581698/response/1393236/attach/3/Attachment.pdf">FOI request revealed</a> that Lambeth is estimated to be spending £94m alone on buying back leasehold properties across its 5 estate demolitions.</p>

<p>Whilst the decant and re-housing programme started in 2016, the estate remains fully occupied with <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/581698/response/1393236/attach/4/Attachment%202.pdf">void units being let out at full market rents or as temporary accommodation at LHA rates</a>.</p>

<p>The estate is not one of those listed as having agreed <a href="/approved/funding">grant funding</a> from the mayor or that has been <a href="/approved/ballotexemptions">exempted</a> from his requirement to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes.</p>
