<p>The Mayor’s <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/better-homes-for-local-people-the-mayors-good-practice-guide-to-estate-regeneration.pdf">Estate Regeneration Policy</a> says that schemes must provide <i>“full rights to return or remain for social tenants, and a fair deal for leaseholders and freeholders.”</i></p>

<h2 id="tenants">Tenants</h2>
<p>In practice, few tenants choose to move or return to redeveloped estates and prefer to move for a number of reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The more precarious security of tenure being a housing association tenant.</li>
  <li>The higher rents - even when reprovided social housing is a social rents.</li>
  <li>Increased service charges and council tax.</li>
  <li>Delays often mean that replacement homes don’t get built for many years after an estate is demolished.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="leaseholdersfreeholders">Leaseholders/freeholders</h2>
<p>The obligation to rehouse tenants and homeowners uprooted by estate regeneration is enshrined within the general legal ‘principle of equivalence’ which says that persons affected by compulsory purchase should be no worse off in financial terms after the compulsory acquisition and <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/8/section/233">section 233(paras 5 &amp; 7) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990</a>, which says that persons compulsorily removed from their homes for planning purposes must be offered <i>‘suitable accommodation’</i> on the redeveloped land <i>‘on terms settled with due regard to the price at which any such land has been acquired from him’.</i></p>

<p>Most boroughs offer a shared-equity scheme to leaseholders which in theory enables them to buy a share in one of the new replacement homes, without having to pay rent on the retained share.</p>

<p>However, many boroughs attach small print to their offer requiring leaseholders to give up their savings or take out a mortgage (on top of any existing mortgage), or in some cases requiring a minimum share of say 50% or 70% (which has the same effect). Some boroughs also deny succession for their shared-equity schemes, meaning that any descendants living with leaseholders would have to sell and move out of their homes when the named leaseholder passes away.</p>

<p>The Mayor continues to turn a blind eye to these practices, despite them being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/16/government-blocks-controversial-plan-to-force-out-housing-estate-residents">deemed unlawful</a> by the Secretary of State at the 2015 Aylesbury estate CPO inquiry, which required Southwark to <a href="http://moderngov.southwarksites.com/documents/s74901/Report%20Amending%20the%20shared%20equity%20rehousing%20policy%20for%20qualifying%20homeowners%20affected%20by%20regenerati.pdf">amend</a> its policy.</p>

<p>Several boroughs also include small print in their fall-back schemes for leaseholders who can’t afford shared equity and who require rehousing as tenants - these are forced to accept just 25% of the market value of their homes.</p>

<p>This is a breach of the Government’s <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/571453/booklet4.pdf">Compulsory Purchase Code</a> which says that:</p>
