I"ò<p>In response to pressure resulting from a numbe of high-profile and controversial estate regeneration schemes, In 2018 the Mayor introduced a number of <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/better-homes-for-local-people-the-mayors-good-practice-guide-to-estate-regeneration.pdf">new policy requirements</a> for estate regeneration:</p>

<ol>
  <li>At least 50% affordable replacement housing with no net loss of social rent.</li>
  <li>A full ballot of residents before proceeding with demolition.</li>
  <li>A right to return to the estate for leaseholders and freeholders.</li>
</ol>

<p>But the Mayor is turning a blind eye to an increasing number of schemes which fail to meet these requirements. We call on the Mayor to â€˜call inâ€™ these schemes and ensure they comply with his policies.</p>
