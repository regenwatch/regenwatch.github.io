I"o<p>271 homes are earmarked for demolition on Barnetâ€™s Douglas Bader Park estate in Colindale.</p>

<p>The estate is under the management of housing association <a href="http://homegroup.org.uk">Home Group</a> and developer/housebuilder <a href="http://hill.co.uk">Hill Group</a>.</p>

<p>In May 2019, residents were balloted on the redevelopment options for the estate, but were <a href="/images/DouglasBaderParkBallot.pdf">told</a> that if they voted against full redevelopment then only essential repairs would be carried out on their homes:</p>

<p>This is slowly <a href="/approved/ballotexemptions/">becoming standard practice</a> in the ballot process - residents are faced with the choice of redevelopment or continued neglect and disinvestment; the option of having their homes refurbished is simply not on the table.</p>
