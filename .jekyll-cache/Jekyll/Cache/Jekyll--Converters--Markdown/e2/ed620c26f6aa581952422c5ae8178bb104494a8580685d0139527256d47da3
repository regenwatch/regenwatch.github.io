I"j<p>101 homes are earmarked for demolition on Lambeth’s South Lambeth estate.</p>

<p>South Lambeth Estate is located on the north-western side of Clapham Road, between Stockwell and Oval underground stations. It is a 2.26 hectare site and comprises six blocks in local authority ownership. The existing estate is comprised of 205 residential units and four retail units. The majority of residents are social housing tenants, although 63 of the dwellings on the estate are owned/occupied by leaseholders.</p>

<p>Lambeth proposes to demolish all homes on the estate with the exception of the high-rise block (Wimborne House) and replace them with 332 new homes of which 42% ‘affordable’.</p>

<p>Planning permission for the redevelopment was granted in March 2018.</p>
