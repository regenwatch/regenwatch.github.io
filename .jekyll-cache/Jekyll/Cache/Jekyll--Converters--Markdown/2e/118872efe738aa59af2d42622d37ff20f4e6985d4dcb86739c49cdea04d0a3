I"Û<p>517 homes are under threat on the Samuda estate in Tower Hamlets. One Housing Group currently manages 2,027 homes across four estates on the Isle of Dogs, which it previously published plans to replace with 8,906 new homes.</p>

<p>The four estates originally belonged to Tower Hamlets Council as part of its housing stock, but were taken over by Toynbee Island Homes in 2005. Two years later, a merger with Community Housing Association led to the creation of <a href="http://onehousing.co.uk">One Housing Group</a>.</p>

<p>In 2014 OHG produced a <a href="/images/ProjectStone.pdf">52 page report - â€˜Project Stoneâ€™</a> setting out proposals to replace all four of its Isle of Dogs estates in a joint venture with developer Argent:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Barkantine estate - 769 homes.</li>
  <li><a href="/estates/towerhamlets/stjohns/">St Johnâ€™s estate</a> - 607 homes.</li>
  <li><a href="/estates/towerhamlets/samuda/">Samuda estate</a> - 517 homes.</li>
  <li><a href="/estates/towerhamlets/kingsbridge/">Kingsbridge estate</a> - 134 homes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Project Stone proposed just 30% of the redeveloped properties as affordable housing. Of these, 17% would have been shared ownership and 13% would have been affordable rented.</p>

<p>The plans met with <a href="http://www.4estatesforum.org.uk">organised opposition</a> from residents on the four estates who had not been consulted and after the Mayor of Tower Hamlets intervened, OHG scrapped its masterplan and agreed that proposals would only be pursued after a â€˜conversationâ€™ with residents.</p>

<p>In May 2017, OHG applied to the Mayor in a bid for funding for the redevelopment of the Kingsbridge estate and has now started â€˜conversationsâ€™ with residents in specific blocks of three of the four estates (Samuda estate excluded):</p>

<p>The Mayor has designated the Isle of Dogs as an â€˜opportunity areaâ€™ and his <a href="https://airdrive-secure.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/london/dataset/isle-of-dogs-and-south-poplar-opportunity-area-planning-framework/2019-10-18T14%3A33%3A23/Appendix%20A%20Isle%20of%20Dogs%20and%20South%20Poplar%20OAPF.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAJJDIMAIVZJDICKHA%2F20200603%2Feu-west-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200603T161828Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=300&amp;X-Amz-Signature=e9f1e1b74bfcd4ea3f185de6fa62ea24ad89c7701eee317bad9d78024ba5474f&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host">planning framework</a> for the area envisages 49,000 new homes some of which provided through the regeneration of existing housing estates:</p>
