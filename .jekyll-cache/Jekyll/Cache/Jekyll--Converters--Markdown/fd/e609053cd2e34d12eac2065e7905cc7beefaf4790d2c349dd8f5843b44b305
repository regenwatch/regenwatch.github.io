I"<p>431 homes are earmarked for demolition on Lambeth’s Fenwick estate in Clapham.</p>

<p>Fenwick is one of the largest of Lambeth’s <a href="/underthreat/lambeth">five estates</a> earmarked for demolition.</p>

<p>It was first earmarked for potential redevelopment in a <a href="https://moderngov.lambeth.gov.uk/documents/s70441/03_Lambeth%20Estate%20Regeneration%20and%20Housing%20Delivery%20-%20December%202014%20v3%20docx.pdf">December 2014 Cabinet decision</a>.</p>

<p>Lambeth <a href="https://moderngov.lambeth.gov.uk/documents/g9750/Publicreports%20pack%20Monday%2011-Jul-2016%2019.00%20Cabinet.pdf?T=10">says</a> that it is demolishing the estate because the cost of refurbishing the existing homes is £14,000 per dwelling higher than the average for its other estates and that the £9m overall cost of refurbishment is poor value for money:</p>

<p>The scheme was stalled in 2018, when the Council was <a href="https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/karakusevic-carson-forces-council-to-rerun-flawed-estate-contest/10028456.article">forced</a> to re-run its procurement process because of a conflict of interests.</p>

<p>The Mayor agreed <a href="/approved/funding">funding</a> for the scheme in 2017, but Lambeth hasn’t yet applied to an <a href="/approved/ballotexemptions">exemption</a> from the Mayor’s requirement to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes.</p>

<p>Whilst the decant and re-housing programme started in 2016, the estate remains fully occupied with <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/581698/response/1393236/attach/4/Attachment%202.pdf">void units being let out at full market rents or as temporary accommodation at LHA rates</a>.</p>
