I"!<p>87 homes and 17 shops are earmarked for demolition as part of Lewisham’s regeneration of the Achilles Street area in New Cross.</p>

<p>The ballot of residents held in October 2019, <a href="https://achillesstreetstopandlisten.wordpress.com/2019/10/22/no-vote-for-business-owners-regarding-the-demolition-of-their-businesses-on-new-cross-road/">failed</a> to give the 17 business owners a say in the plans and <a href="https://achillesstreetstopandlisten.wordpress.com/2019/10/10/for-immediate-release/">failed</a> to offer refurbishment as an option.</p>

<p>Campaingers have also <a href="https://achillesstreetstopandlisten.wordpress.com/2019/10/10/for-immediate-release/">revealed</a> that over the past 6 years the Council has spent less than 10% of its rental income from the affected tenants and businesses on maintaining their buildings.</p>

<p>59 of the 89 eligible residents voted in favour of redevelopment. Temporary tenants were included as eligible to vote and were <a href="https://achillesstreetstopandlisten.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/appendix-a-achilles-street-landlord-offer.pdf">offered</a> secure tenancies if they voted in favour of the scheme. The homes and shops affected are shown in the plan below:</p>
