I"þ<p>Following a string of high-profile schemes where estates were regenerated against the wishes of its residents, in 201x Mayor Sadiq Khan introduced a requirement for residents to be balloted before estate regeneration could proceed. But when he introduced this policy, he exempted a large number of schemes from meeting the ballot requirement <a href=""></a> and introduced a further list of exemptions <a href=""></a>.</p>

<p>In addition, councilâ€™s and developers have come up with a number of inventive ways of getting round the ballot requirement:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Councilâ€™s and developers are avoiding applying for funding to evade the ballot requirement (cf. Winstanley/Ebury Bridge estates etc).</li>
  <li>Residents not being given a â€˜do nothingâ€™ option on the ballot paper (cf. Teviot estate).</li>
  <li>Residents being told that if they vote against regeneration then their estate wonâ€™t be maintained (cf. St Raphaelâ€™s estate)</li>
  <li>Sadiq Khan ignoring the ballot requirement altogether (cf. Grange Farm estate)</li>
</ol>
