I"<p>820 homes have been earmarked for demoliton on Kingston’s Cambridge Road estate.</p>

<p>In October 2016, Kingston published a <a href="https://www.kingston.gov.uk/downloads/download/611/direction_of_travel_for_kingston">Direction of Travel document</a>, prepared by Kingston Council in collaboration with the Mayor of London, which identified potential opportunities for growth, infrastructure and investment in the borough. The Cambridge Road estate was one of the sites identified for potential redevelopment.</p>

<p>In November 2019, Kingston signed a development agreement with developer Countryside Properties for the redevelopment of the estate.</p>

<p>In March 2020, residents were balloted on the redevelopment proposals with the majority of residents voting in favour of redevelopment.</p>

<p>This was perhaps the result of Kingston’s <a href="/images/cambridgeroadoffer.pdf">‘Landlord offer’</a> to residents ahead of the ballot, which told them that if they voted against demolition then they would only see essential maintenance to their estate and repairs as reported.</p>

<p>The scheme is now in design stage while a planning application is drawn up and submitted.</p>
