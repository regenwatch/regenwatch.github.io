I"<p>179 homes are under threat of demolition on the latest phase of Barking &amp; Dagenham’s Gascoigne estate regeneration.</p>

<p>In Dec 2018, the Mayor <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/planning-applications-and-decisions/planning-application-search/gascoigne-estate-west">approved</a> the demolition of 179 homes on the latest phase of scheme (Gascoigne estate - west).</p>

<p>The definition of ‘London Affordable Rent’ in the <a href="http://paplan.lbbd.gov.uk/online-applications/files/F07E42E8C4ADF9FDBF7F485D098282EA/pdf/17_00977_OUT-S106_AGREEMENT-272961.pdf">planning consent</a> allows rents of up to 80% market rent.</p>

<p>These replacement ‘affordable’ homes have been funded by the Mayor and the estate was exempted by the Mayor from his requirement to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes.</p>

<p>Compulsory Purchase Orders have been issued and demolition is due to start in 2020.</p>
