I"K<p>306 homes are earmarked for demolition on Lambeth’s Cressingham Gardens estate at Brockwell Park.</p>

<p>In 2016, Lambeth Council <a href="https://moderngov.lambeth.gov.uk/documents/s80093/Cabinet%20Report%20-%20March%202016%20v8.pdf">took the decision</a> to demolish the estate based on fact that refurbishment estimates were £14,000 higher per dwelling than the rest of its estates and this represents ‘poor value for money’:</p>

<p>Lambeth also claims that the redevelopment of the estate will result in the provision of more ‘affordable’ housing to address the housing crisis. It plans to reprovide the existing council homes and provide an extra 27 at council rent plus a further 48 at ‘no higher than LHA rates’:</p>

<p>The estate is one of <a href="/underthreat/lambeth/">four estates</a> earmarked for demolition in Lambeth’s estate renewal programme. It is not among those granted an <a href="/approved/ballotexemptions">exemption</a> from the Mayor’s requirement to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes.</p>
