I"ê<p>Circa 100 homes are earmarked for demolition on Hackney‚Äôs New Era estate in Hoxton by housing association Dolphin Living.</p>

<p>The estate is situated adjacent to the <a href="/estates/hackney/colville">Colville estate</a> which is also undergoing redevelopment.</p>

<p>New Era was at the heart of protests supported by Russell Brand back in 2014 after its owners threatened rent hikes which could have led to the break up of the estate‚Äôs tight-knit community.</p>

<p>Plans approved by Hackney Council in July 2020 supposedly enable the current 78 tenants to be able to return to a flat of equivalent size in a redeveloped New Era, with the same number of bedrooms, at a rent level no higher than if the estate had not been developed.</p>

<p>The redevelopment will double the density with 199 new residential units and 344sqm of retail floorspace provided across buildings ranging from three to 14 storeys.</p>

<p>While original tenants will see no change to their rental arrangements if they return to the estate, once they move out their successors will not enjoy the same deals. This is in contrast to the London Plan requirement that affordable housing be secured in perpetuity.</p>

<p>In total, 35 per cent of the newly redeveloped estate will be affordable, with 47 flats let at up to 80 per cent of market rent and 21 at London Living rent levels, well below the 50 per cent required by the Mayor.</p>
