I"∂<p>793 homes on the St Raphael‚Äôs estate in Neasden have been earmarked for potential demolition by Brent Council (see area A in map below).</p>

<p>The estate comprises a mix of low-rise three and four-storey maisonette blocks and detached town houses, situated in an area of greenspace alongside the river Brent.</p>

<p>This extract from a <a href="http://democracy.brent.gov.uk/documents/s74722/07.%20St%20Raphaels%20Estate%20Cabinet%20Report.pdf">2018 options appraisal</a> confirms that the estate is home to a large proportion of BAME communities:</p>

<p>Within the estate is a church (St Patrick‚Äôs Roman Catholic Church) and a Tenants &amp; Residents Association Hall (Henderson Hall).</p>

<p>In 2018 Brent Council conducted an <a href="http://democracy.brent.gov.uk/documents/s74722/07.%20St%20Raphaels%20Estate%20Cabinet%20Report.pdf">options appraisal</a> which confirmed that <em>‚Äúa stock condition survey was undertaken during August and September 2018. The findings of the survey reveal the properties to be in a reasonable state of repair (para 3.5).‚Äù</em> However, it went on to attribute recent crime and anti-social behaviour issues to the poor design of the estate, which can only be addressed by full redevelopment.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://democracy.brent.gov.uk/documents/s92415/09.%20Cabinet%20Report_Future%20St%20Raphaels%20Masterplanning_Final%2026%2011%2019.pdf">Dec 2019 Cabinet report</a> acknowledges that the redevelopment scheme is currently unviable and that if it proceeds using current day values there will be a ¬£22m viability gap, meaning that Brent could end up subsidising this or making concessions on design, affordability or infrastructure.</p>

<p>A ballot is expected to be held in Autumn 2020, with two options for residents to choose from; infill or comprehensive redevelopment. Brent Council‚Äôs <a href="/images/st-raphaels-faq.pdf">FAQ document</a> (distributed to residents in Dec 2019) makes it clear that if infill is the preferred option then the estate may not receive any investment for improving current housing conditions:</p>

<h2 id="rehousing-offer">Rehousing offer</h2>
<p>The small print in Brent‚Äôs <a href="http://democracy.brent.gov.uk/documents/s60550/Improving%20the%20Housing%20Offer%20for%20Tenants%20and%20Leaseholders.pdf">rehousing offer</a> to leaseholders fails to provide a credible right of return to leaseholders on the redeveloped estate.</p>

<p>Brent requires leaseholders to be able to afford a minimum 50% share in a shared equity home on the redeveloped estate, as well as requiring them to contribute their personal savings into their share(paras 5.8.2 and 5.8.3).</p>

<p>This was <a href="https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/javid-rejects-aylesbury-cpo-bid-on-human-rights-grounds-48078">ruled unlawful</a> by the Secretary of State following a public inquiry for Aylesbury estate leaseholders in 2015, where Southwark Council had to revise its policy to require a 25% minimum share without savings contributions and with several other concessions i.e. - succession rights, proportioned service charge payments, stamp duty etc. See <a href="https://regenwatch.github.io/guide/#leaseholders">here</a> for more information on leaseholders‚Äô rights.</p>
