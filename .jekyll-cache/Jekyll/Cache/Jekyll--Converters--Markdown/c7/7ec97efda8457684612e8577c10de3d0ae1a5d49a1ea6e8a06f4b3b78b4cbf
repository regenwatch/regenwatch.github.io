I"A	<p>Newham Council’s <a href="https://www.newham.gov.uk/regeneration-1/regeneration-project-carpenters-estate/2?documentId=343&amp;categoryId=20140">website</a> for the Carpenters estate regeneration says the following:</p>

<blockquote>
Plans to regenerate the estate first started in 2003 when a Masterplan was discussed and agreed with the TMO, with decanting of residents commencing the following year, with over half the homes now being empty. 

From 2005 to 2010, redevelopment proposals focused on the demolition of the high rise blocks and some central low rise blocks to be replaced with alternative housing. Then came failed discussions with the University College London to develop the estate and Newham Council ceased the procurement of a joint venture partner, as there was limited evidence that residents had been fully engaged with redevelopment proposals. Newham Council is now committed to implementing a programme of consultation and engagement with residents which will inform the Carpenters Estate redevelopment options.

In February 2020 the Council gave approval for Red Door Ventures (RDV) to provide development management services for the next stage of work for the restoration of the estate. RDV are a developer of private and affordable homes and are solely owned by the Council. RDV, working closely, with the council, now leads on discussions with residents to co-design a viable and deliverable development option.  

RDV and the Council are working closely with residents to create a detailed vision for the Carpenters Estate and turn this into a financially viable masterplan. This plan will contain a clear ambition for the future of the estate, looking at how it will ensure it is restored as a neighbourhood and how it will connect to the wider Stratford area.

<p>The <a href="https://www.newham.gov.uk/downloads/file/654/carpenters-estate-issue-4-december-2019">most recent newsletter</a> for the regeneration (Nov 2019) says that residents were polled on various levels of intervention for the new plans and that the low-intervention proposals were most popular.</p>

<p>The newsletter goes on to say that once financial modelling has been undertaken a ballot will be held before any option is finally progressed.</p>
