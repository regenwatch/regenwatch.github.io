I"¶<p>Circa 250 homes are under threat of potential demolition on Suttonâ€™s Collingwood estate.</p>

<p>The Collingwood estate comprises one high-rise block surrounded by a dozen 4-6 storey maisonette blocks, situated behind Sutton High Street, near Collingwood park and West Sutton train station.</p>

<p>In 2013, the high-rise block on the estate (Balaam House) was clad with a light-blue aluminiumn composite material. In 2017, following the investigations as a result of the Grenfell disaster, it was <a href="https://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/15372936.we-feel-so-unsafe-sutton-tower-block-residents-at-balaam-house-say-they-are-living-in-fear-after-grenfell-to/">revealed</a> that the cladding had failed safety tests.</p>

<p>In 2018, the Collingwood estate was one of seven estates listed in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MdX6GlaHDoBdG6CTsvjFaIuPtIa9id5O/view">Suttonâ€™s Local Plan (2018)</a> for potential redevelopment:</p>
