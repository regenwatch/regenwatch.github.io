I"”<p>Havelock estate is located in Southall overlooking the Grand Union Canal. It comprises a mix of 1950s and 1970s blocks and has a total of 845 homes.</p>

<p>Ealing Council says that it is redeveloping the estate in a joint venture with Catalyst housing association over four phases, and that the redeveloped estate will provide affordable rented homes (i.e. up to 80% market rent).</p>

<p>The replacement of the existing social rented homes with the affordable rent tenure is confirmed in the <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/public%3A//public%3A//PAWS/media_id_19485///1_havelock_estate_masterplan_report.pdf">Mayorâ€™s planning report</a> for the scheme.</p>

<p>Phase 1 of the scheme is underway and nearing completion. Homes are being marketed for sale in anticipation by Catalyst at <a href="http://www.southallvillage.co.uk">www.southallvillage.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p>In April 2019, Ealing Council <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201104/housing_regeneration/374/havelock_estate/3">announced</a> that it had written to all residents advising that a review of the scheme would take place.</p>

<p>There is no information relating to a right to return for tenants or leaseholders already decanted from phase 1.</p>
