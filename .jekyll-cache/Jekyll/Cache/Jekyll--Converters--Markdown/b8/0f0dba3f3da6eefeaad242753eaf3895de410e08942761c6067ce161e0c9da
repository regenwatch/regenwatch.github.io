<p>The estate borders the Limehouse Cut canal to the North, the River Lea to the East and Langdon Park and Balfron Tower to the South. Poplar HARCA have already come under <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/sep/19/balfron-20-how-goldfingers-utopian-tower-became-luxury-flats">criticism</a> for its privatisation of Balfron Tower.</p>

<p>The scheme is part of Poplar HARCA’s ‘Poplar Reshaping’ masterplan which envisages the redevelopment of ten estates: Aberfeldy, Brownfield, Bow Bridge, Coventry Cross, Burdett, Devons, Lansbury, Leopold, Lincoln and Teviot.</p>

<p><a href="/images/teviotoffer.pdf">Rehousing offer</a> is more generous than most (with the exception of Merton). It allows a certain amount of the equity loan to be written off after 7 years. This is in line with the [government’s guidance]..</p>
