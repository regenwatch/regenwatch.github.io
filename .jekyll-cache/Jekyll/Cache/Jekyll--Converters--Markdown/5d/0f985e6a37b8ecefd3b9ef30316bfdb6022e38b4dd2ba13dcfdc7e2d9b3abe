I"<p>The Grahame Park Estate was constructed in the 1970s by the GLC on the site of the former Hendon Aerodrome and is Barnet’s largest housing estate with <a href="https://www.barnet.gov.uk/planning-and-building/planning-policies/local-plan/grahame-park-july-2016">1,777 homes</a>. Barnet Council appointed Notting Hill Genesis in 2002 to redevelop the estate.</p>

<p>Barnet <a href="https://www.barnet.gov.uk/grahame-park">says that it plans to retain around 25% of the homes on the estate</a></p>

<p>A small initial redevelopment phase was completed in 2012 (stage A). Notting Hill Genesis recently <a href="https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/sadiq-khan-approves-housing-associations-2000-home-estate-regeneration-plan-66346">received planning consent</a> for the next phase (plots 10-12) after its application was initially refused due to the proposed net loss of social rented housing. This phase will provide 32 homes at ‘target rents’ to existing permanent tenants, 314 London Affordable Rented and 699 shared ownership homes.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/gla_grahame_park_estate_fva_comments_march_2020_redacted.pdf">GLA briefing paper</a> confirms that the land is being transferred to Notting Hill Genesis at no cost (para 4.2). This is also confirmed in section 6.2 of the <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/gp_stage_b_financial_viability_assessment_report_v4.0.pdf">Financial Viability Assessment</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/gp_stage_b_financial_viability_assessment_report_v4.0.pdf">Financial Viability Assessment</a> commissioned by Notting Hill Genesis and submitted to the GLA justifying the low levels of social rented housing, confirms that Notting Hill’s target profit for this phase of the scheme is £105m and that current estimates say it will achieve £66m.</p>

<p>The GLA’s stage 1 report says that <em>“while Plots 13 to 16 are expected to come forward over the longer term; Plots 17 to 21 are not expected to come forward for development. “</em></p>

<p>In May 2020, it was <a href="https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/sadiq-khan-approves-housing-associations-2000-home-estate-regeneration-plan-66346">reported</a> that Barnet Council had agreed to spend £33m on repairs to the estate for maintenance upkeep whilst redevelopment is pending.</p>

<p>The scheme is being funded by the Mayor and has been exempted from his requirement to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes. Neither the Mayor’s stage 2 report or section 106 agreement are publicly available at this stage.</p>
