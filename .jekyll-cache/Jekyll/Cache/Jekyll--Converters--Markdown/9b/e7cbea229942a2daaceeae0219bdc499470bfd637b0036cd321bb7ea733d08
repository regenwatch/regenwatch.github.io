I"ë	<p>464 homes on Ealingâ€™s Green Man Lane estate are earmarked for demolition.</p>

<p>The Green Man Lane estate regeneration is a joint venture between Ealing Council, developer Rydon and A2Dominion housing association involving the phased demolition of the estateâ€™s 464 homes in four phases over 10 years.</p>

<p>Ealing Council <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201104/housing_regeneration/373/green_man_lane/2">describes</a> the replacement social housing as â€˜affordable rentâ€™ tenure, which can mean anything up to 80% market rent.</p>

<p>In December 2016, Ealing <a href="https://pam.ealing.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&amp;keyVal=ODI3M8JM09L00">granted planning permission</a> for phase 3 of the regeneration. There are no publicly available section 106 agreements for the scheme so it is not possible to confirm the precise tenure of the replacement â€˜affordableâ€™ housing.</p>

<p>Phase 4 of the scheme appears to have been stalled - there are no planning applications, demolition notices or other information relating to phse 4 available online.</p>

<p>There is no information relating to a right to return for tenants or leaseholders.
