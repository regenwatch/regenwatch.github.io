I"À<p>The Friary Park estate is located within Acton and comprises 230 homes, including 225 social rent units and 5 privately owned units. The estate was constructed in the 1980s and is predominately 2/3 storey in height. The units are predominantly flats laid out in buildings up to four stories in height.</p>

<p>The estate also contains a community hall of 211sqm and a basketball court. The site sits opposite Acton Main Line rail station, which will also benefit from Crossrail services once the Elizabeth Line is operational.</p>

<p>Planning permission for the redevelopment of the estate was granted in November 2019. Despite being funded by the Mayor and exempted from his requirement to ballot residents, there is no stage 2 report available on the <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/planning-applications-and-decisions/planning-application-search/friary-park-estate">GLA planning portal</a> confirming the Mayorâ€™s approval of the scheme.</p>

<p>Neither is a section 106 agreement publicly available so it is not possible to confirm whether any replacement social housing is social rented tenure or affordable rent (up to 80% market rent) or if it has been secured in perpetuity.</p>
