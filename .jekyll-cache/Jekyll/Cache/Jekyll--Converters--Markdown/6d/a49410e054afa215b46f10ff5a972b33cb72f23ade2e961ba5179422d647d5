I"<p>Circa 1,000 homes are under threat of potential demolition on Westminster’s Lisson Green estate in Maida Vale.</p>

<p>The estate, which is situated beside the Regent’s Canal and Regent’s Park sits <a href="https://lbhf.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=7cab3cdf6e344a0fb24df59ed6b9bdc5">within</a> an area that has been designated a <strong>Housing Renewal</strong> zone in Westminster’s <a href="https://www.westminster.gov.uk/cityplan2040">draft 2019-2040 Local Plan</a>.</p>

<p>The estate is also inside the boundary of the <strong>Edgeware Road Housing Zone</strong>, one of <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/housing-and-land/increasing-housing-supply/housing-zones#acc-i-42741">30 special housing zones</a> designated by the Mayor to deliver accelerated housing development. The Edgeware Road zone is expected to deliver 1700 new homes.</p>

<p>In addition, the estate is within the boundary of the Church Street regeneration area. Whilst its redevelopment does not form part of the current Church Street proposals, the <a href="https://www.westminster.gov.uk/sites/default/files/ev_h_008_church_street_masterplan_wcc_2017.pdf">Church Street masterplan</a> does consider the estate <em>‘suitable for future development’</em> and the Council <em>‘intends to develop dialogue with residents .. to better understand how they would like their area to develop and be integrated within the wider regeneration opportunity.’</em></p>

<p>Two blocks on the estate have recently been incorporated into the Church St regeneration plans and are currently being demolished.</p>
