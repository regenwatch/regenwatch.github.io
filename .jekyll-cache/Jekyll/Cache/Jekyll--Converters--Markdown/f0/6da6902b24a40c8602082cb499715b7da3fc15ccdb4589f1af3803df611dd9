I"ª<p>Circa 250 homes have been earmarked for potential demolition on Suttonâ€™s Chaucer Gardens estate.</p>

<p>The Chaucer estate comprises one 16-storey high-rise block (Chaucer House) surrounded by a dozen 2-4 storey maisonette blocks, situated behind Sutton High Street, near Collingwood park and West Sutton train station.</p>

<p>In 2013, the high-rise block on the estate was clad with a light-blue Aluminium composite material. In 2017, after the investigations following the Grenfell disaster, it was <a href="https://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/15387026.sutton-housing-partnership-sutton-council-and-sutton-fire-commander-meet-concerned-residents-living-in-chaucer-house-sutton/">revealed</a> that the cladding had failed safety tests.</p>

<p>In 2018, the Chaucer estate was one of seven estates listed in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MdX6GlaHDoBdG6CTsvjFaIuPtIa9id5O/view">Suttonâ€™s Local Plan (2018)</a> for potential redevelopment:</p>
