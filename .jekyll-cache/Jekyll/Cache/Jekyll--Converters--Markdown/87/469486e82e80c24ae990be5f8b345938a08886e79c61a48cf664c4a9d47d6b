I"•<p>The ballot of â€˜eligibleâ€™ residents on Stepneyâ€™s <a href="https://estatewatch.github.io/estates/towerhamlets/clichyestate/">Clichy estate</a> went ahead despite <a href="https://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/lgnl/council_and_democracy/consultations/Housing-consultations/HAP_Houses.aspx">consultation sessions being cancelled due to the Coronavirus</a>:</p>

<p>Residents had previously been consulted on an â€˜infillâ€™ option as well as full redevelopment. But the <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/clichy_estate_ballot_paper_accom?nocache=incoming-1565802#incoming-1565802">info pack</a> sent to residents with the ballot papers asked only whether they wanted full redevelopment or not. leaseholders were <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/658746/response/1565802/attach/4/Ballot%20information%20requested%201.pdf">told</a> if they voted against redevelopment then they would be faced with major bills. Residents were told that if they donâ€™t vote for full redevelopment then they will likely be faced with the infill option anyway:</p>

<p>This follows Tower Hamletsâ€™ ballot of Teviot estate residents where they <a href="https://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/news/politics/teviot-housing-estate-regeneration-voted-1-6052355">werenâ€™t asked if they wanted regeneration in the first place</a>.</p>

<p>Similar choices were faced by residents of the West Kentish Town estate in Camden:</p>

<p>Brent Councilâ€™s <a href="/images/st-raphaels-faq.pdf">infopack</a> (distributed to residents in Dec 2019 ahead of the ballot) makes it clear that if infill is the preferred option then their estate may also not receive any investment for improving current housing conditions:</p>

<p>The <a href="/images/DouglasBaderParkBallot.pdf">infopack</a> given to residents of the Douglas Bader Park estate contains a similar threat:</p>

<p>This becoming a common element when it comes to estate regeneration ballots. Certain options are taken off the table when it comes to the ballot paper and residents are told to vote for full redevelopment or face many more years of running the estate down. Refurbishment or scheduled maintenance as usual are simply not presented as an option.</p>

<p>This, coupled with incentives to tenants like the offer of an extra bedroom if they are overoccupying or offers of secure tenancies to licencess has become a winning formula for Councilâ€™s looking to gain tenantsâ€™ support for their schemes.</p>

<p>The Mayorâ€™s policy guidance on ballots specifically says that refurbishment needs to be an option but it would appear he is turning a blind eye to what is becoming a common practice in the regeneration game.</p>
