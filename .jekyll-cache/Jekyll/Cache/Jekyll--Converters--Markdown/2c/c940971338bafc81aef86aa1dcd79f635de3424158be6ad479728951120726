I"£<p>Church street estate is located in Maida Vale, situated beside the Regentâ€™s Canal and in close proximity of Regentâ€™s Park.
It is also <a href="https://lbhf.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=7cab3cdf6e344a0fb24df59ed6b9bdc5">located</a> within an area that has been designated a <strong>Housing Renewal</strong> zone in Westminsterâ€™s <a href="https://www.westminster.gov.uk/cityplan2040">draft 2019-2040 Local Plan</a>.</p>

<p>It is also within the boundary of the <strong>Edgeware Road Housing Zone</strong>, one of <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/housing-and-land/increasing-housing-supply/housing-zones#acc-i-42741">30 special housing zones</a> designated by the Mayor to deliver accelerated housing development. The Edgeware Road zone is expected to deliver 1700 new homes.</p>

<p>Some blocks on the estate were specifically earmarked for demolition in the 2012 Masterplan, although the <a href="https://committees.westminster.gov.uk/documents/s24437/Church_Street_masterplan__boards.pdf">current masterplan</a> does envisage including further blocks for demolition over the next 15-20 years.</p>
