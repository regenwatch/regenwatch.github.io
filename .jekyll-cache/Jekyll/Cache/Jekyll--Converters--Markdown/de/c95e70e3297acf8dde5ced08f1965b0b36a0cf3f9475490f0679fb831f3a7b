I"ˆ	<p>In November 2016, the Mayor <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/public%3A//public%3A//PAWS/media_id_286565///abbey_wood_and_south_thamesmead_report.pdf">approved</a> the demolition of 226 homes on Bexleyâ€™s Southmere site of the Thamesmead estate, to be replaced by 1,622 new homes of which 67 intermediate and 168 affordable rent of up to 80% market rent.</p>

<p>This is the first phase of â€˜Thamesmead Southâ€™ - Peabodyâ€™s redevelopment of the Bexley side of the Thamesmead estate. The next phase is Thamesmead East - the <a href="https://estatewatch.london/estates/bexley/thamesmeadeast/">â€˜Wolvercote roadâ€™ area</a>.</p>

<p>Bexleyâ€™s <a href="https://www.bexley.gov.uk/sites/default/files/2018-02/Bexley-Growth-Strategy.pdf">Growth Strategy</a> envisages 4,000 new homes in the Thamesmead area facilitated by the new Crossrail station and including the â€˜renewalâ€™ of existing estates.</p>

<p>Peabody has <a href="https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/peabody-picks-lendlease-for-8bn-thamesmead-regeneration-60192">partnered with Australian developer Lendlease</a> (Heygate estate regeneration) to deliver 11,500 homes in Thamesmead over the next 30 years.</p>

<p>Unlike in some cases, the Mayors <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/public%3A//public%3A//PAWS/media_id_286565///abbey_wood_and_south_thamesmead_report.pdf">report</a> is clear that the replacement â€˜socialâ€™ housing at rent levels of up to 80% market rent:</p>

<p>The <a href="/images/thamesmeadsouths106.pdf">section 106 agreement</a> agreement says that Peabody should â€˜endeavourâ€™ to provide 35% affordable housing across all phases but only secures a minimum number of units in the first phase, namely 67 intermediate and 168 affordable rent of up to 80% market rent.</p>
