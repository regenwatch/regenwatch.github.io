I"8<p>864 homes are earmarked for demolition on Lambeth’s Clapham Park estate.</p>

<p>Lambeth Borough Council transferred the estate housing stock to Metropolitan over a decade ago. To date, more than 500 homes have been built and 700 refurbished under the original 2008 masterplan.</p>

<p>In 2018 Metropolitan applied to extend the scheme to include demolition of futher buildings in a revised masterplan.</p>

<p>The new scheme is being <a href="/approved/funding">funded</a> by the Mayor but hasn’t been <a href="/approved/ballotexemptions">exempted</a> from his requirement to ballot residents.</p>

<p>In the Mayor’s <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/public%3A//public%3A//PAWS/media_id_482169///clapham_park_estate_report.pdf">July 2019 planning report</a> approving the scheme, it is argued that a ballot is not required because the original scheme was approved before his ballot requirement became effective in 2018.</p>
