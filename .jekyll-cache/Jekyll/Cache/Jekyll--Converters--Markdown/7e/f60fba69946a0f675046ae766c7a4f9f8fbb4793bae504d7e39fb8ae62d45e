I"Ä<p>Circa 150 homes are under threat of demolition on Haveringâ€™s Maygreen Crescent estate in Hornchurch.</p>

<p>The estate has been earmarked for redevelopment as part of Haveringâ€™s <a href="https://www.wates.co.uk/articles/case-study/borough-of-havering-housing-redevelopment/">Â£1bn joint venture with developer Wates Residential</a> which will see 12 of the boroughâ€™s estates redeveloped.</p>

<p>The scheme has not yet applied for <a href="/approved/funding">funding</a> from the Mayor or been exempted from his <a href="/approved/ballotexemptions">requirement</a> to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes. It is unclear whether Havering intends to ballot residents at this stage.</p>
