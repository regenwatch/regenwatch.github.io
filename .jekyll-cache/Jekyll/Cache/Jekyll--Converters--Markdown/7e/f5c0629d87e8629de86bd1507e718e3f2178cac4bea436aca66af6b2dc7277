I"þ<p>In January 2020, Hounslowâ€™s Cabinet <a href="https://democraticservices.hounslow.gov.uk/documents/s157644/CEX432%20Housing%20Estate%20Regeneration%20Programme.pdf">agreed a comprehensive review</a> of its 171 council estates with a view to infill or redevelopment.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://democraticservices.hounslow.gov.uk/documents/s157644/CEX432%20Housing%20Estate%20Regeneration%20Programme.pdf">Cabinet report</a> it was agreed that six estates had already been identified as â€˜poor performing estatesâ€™.</p>

<p>The six estates are: the Brabazon estate; the Brookwood estate; Charlton House; the Convent Way estate; the Norman Crescent estate and the Oriel estate.</p>

<p>The Convent Way estate was identified as the most likely of these â€˜poor performing estatesâ€™ that would benefit from early regeneration.</p>

<p>The estate was originally built in 1967. It comprises of one 12 storytower block, 16 medium rise (3 to 5 storey) blocks. In total the estate comprises 440 homes. In addition, the estate contains a health centre, community centre, and a small shopping parade.</p>

<p>The Council suggests that the redeveloped estate could comprise up to a possible 1100 new homes, a community centre, play areas and improved public transport links.</p>

<p>The Councilâ€™s <a href="https://democraticservices.hounslow.gov.uk/documents/s157644/CEX432%20Housing%20Estate%20Regeneration%20Programme.pdf">2020 Cabinet report</a> explains that the estate was chosen after an audit showed it faced increasing bills for maintenance as well as concerns over nuisance behaviour like fly-tipping.</p>

<p>It was also deemed unlikely the estate would be able to meet the councilâ€™s energy efficiency targets.</p>
