I"Ã<p>Circa 200 homes are under threat of demolition at Haveringâ€™s Farnham and Hilldene estate in Harold Hill.</p>

<p>The proposals also include the parades of shops above which the homes are situated.</p>

<p>The estate has been earmarked for redevelopment as part of Haveringâ€™s <a href="https://www.wates.co.uk/articles/case-study/borough-of-havering-housing-redevelopment/">Â£1bn joint venture with developer Wates Residential</a> which will see 12 of the boroughâ€™s estates redeveloped.</p>

<p>The scheme has not yet applied for <a href="/approved/funding">funding</a> from the Mayor or been exempted from his <a href="/approved/ballotexemptions">requirement</a> to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes. It is unclear whether Havering intends to ballot residents at this stage.</p>

<p>In Haveringâ€™s <a href="https://www.investinhavering.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Vision-interactive-map.pdf">investment prospectus</a>, it originally said it wanted to explore building above the existing homes and shops. But in March 2019 the Council <a href="https://www.romfordrecorder.co.uk/news/havering-council-plans-for-regeneration-in-harold-hill-1-5944449">said</a> that it prefers the option of wholesale redevelopment. provides further details of the scheme.
