<p>It also acknowledges that the replacement ‘social’ housing will be ‘affordable rent’ in tenure - i.e. up to 80% market rents.</p>

If leaseholders want to take up a new home on the redeveloped estate they will have to do so under a shared-ownership agreement - ie. paying rent on the unowned proportion.</p>

<p>In July 2019, Greenwich approved a decision to start compulsory purchase proceedings against the remaining leaseholders on the estate. As at June 2020 the CPO proceedings had not yet commenced.</p>
