I"<p>In June 2019, the Mayor gave provisional approval to the demolition of 102 homes on Barnet’s Mills Grove and Westhorpe estate. The Mayor’s <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/PAWS/media_id_464602/westthrope_gardens_and_mill_grove_estate_report.pdf">report</a> says that the scheme complies with his minimum 50% affordable housing requirement and that there will be no net loss of social rented accommodation.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://publicaccess.barnet.gov.uk/online-applications/files/DB1BCDA5BA11ED66C650A0ECAAA014EE/pdf/18_7495_FUL-AFFORDABLE_HOUSING_STATEMENT_FV-4303171.pdf">planning documents</a> show that while there will be a net increase of 3 social rented homes, there will be a net loss of 3,738 square metres of social rented floorspace because the replacement homes will be smaller.</p>

<p>There is no publicly available section 106 agreement on <a href="https://publicaccess.barnet.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&amp;keyVal=PJZA9IJI09W00">Barnet’s planning portal</a> so it is impossible to confirm whether the replacement ‘social’ housing has been secured as social rent in perpetuity or affordable rent (up to 80% market rent).</p>
