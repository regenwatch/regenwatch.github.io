I"®<p>795 homes on Enfieldâ€™s Joyce Avenue and Snells Park estates in Edmonton have been <a href="https://new.enfield.gov.uk/services/housing/housing-development-and-renewal/joyce-avenue-and-snells-park-leaflet-housing.pdf">earmarked for demolition</a> by Enfield Council.</p>

<p>The Council is <a href="https://enfielddispatch.co.uk/major-estate-plans-to-go-to-vote/">reported</a> to be intending to hold a ballot some time in 2020. Its dedicated website for the scheme provides further details <a href="http://www.joyceandsnells.co.uk/">here</a>.</p>

<p>In 2015, Enfieldâ€™s Cabinet <a href="https://governance.enfield.gov.uk/documents/g9278/Public%20reports%20pack%2018th-Nov-2015%2020.15%20Cabinet.pdf?T=10">agreed</a> to consider charging affordable rent for new council homes built as part of its estate renewals, albeit not necessarily at the full 80% of market rent.</p>

<p>The redevelopment plans date back to October 2015, when the Councilâ€™s Cabinet agreed an Estate Renewal Programme (2016-2025) setting out its plans for redeveloping a number of its council estates (item 24):
<a href="https://governance.enfield.gov.uk/documents/s54537/final1610Estate%20Renewal%20Cabinet%20Report%20-%20Oct%202015%20Final%20v12%2015.10.15%202.pdf">https://governance.enfield.gov.uk/documents/s54537/final1610Estate%20Renewal%20Cabinet%20Report%20-%20Oct%202015%20Final%20v12%2015.10.15%202.pdf</a></p>

<p>Appendix 2 to that report, which lists the estates earmarked for renewal, has been witheld by the Council on grounds of commercial sensitivity.</p>
