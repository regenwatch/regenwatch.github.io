I"e<p>Circa 300 homes remain under threat of demolition as part of Newham’s regeneration of the Custom House area.</p>

<p>A number of council estates were earmarked for redevelopment in Newham’s <a href="https://www.newham.gov.uk/Documents/Environment%20and%20planning/CanningTownCustomHouseAdoptedSPD2008%5B1%5D.pdf">Custom House &amp; Canning Town regeneration masterplan</a>, which set out 20 development sites.</p>

<p>The Canning Town side of the scheme is nearing completion but the Custom House estates are yet to be redeveloped. These are marked out on the South-west corner of the masterplan map below.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.newham.gov.uk/Documents/Environment%20and%20planning/CustomHouseRegenerationFAQs.pdf">This July 2019 update</a> from Newham confirms that the Council is in the process of rehousing tenants from Area 6 and Area 9 but that Areas 4,5 and 18 will not be decanted in the short term.</p>

<p>In February 2017, Area 16 (previously designated for enhancement) was <a href="https://www.newham.gov.uk/Documents/Environment%20and%20planning/LPRIssuesOptionPart2.pdf">designated</a> as an extension to the Area 5 development site.</p>

<p>In 2018, the <a href="">PEACH group - Peoples Empowerment Alliance for Custom House</a> launched its own <a href="http://www.peach-e16.org.uk/index.php/housing/109-peach-regeneration-manifesto-2018">regeneration manifesto</a> for the regeneration of the Custom House area:</p>
