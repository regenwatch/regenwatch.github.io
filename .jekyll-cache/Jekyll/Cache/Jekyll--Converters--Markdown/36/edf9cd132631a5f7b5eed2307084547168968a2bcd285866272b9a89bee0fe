I"<p>Circa 800 homes remain under threat of demolition at Brent’s redevelopment of the South Kilburn estate.</p>

<p>The redevelopment of the current proposals for the South Kilburn estate are based on the <a href="https://www.brent.gov.uk/your-community/regeneration/south-kilburn-regeneration/the-development-process/masterplan-and-programme?tab=southkilburnsupplementaryplanningdocument2017">2017 approved masterplan.</a>.</p>

<p>The first phase of the scheme has seen four sites (marked in blue below) granted planning permission and which are currently underway. As of July 2019 there remained 17 blocks in the second half of the scheme earmarked for demolition (shaded orange), but these are yet to seek planning consent  - see <a href="http://democracy.brent.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=455&amp;MId=5355&amp;Ver=4">this Cabinet report</a>, item 7.</p>

<p>A ballot of residents in the second phase of the scheme returned a positive result <a href="https://www.kilburntimes.co.uk/news/south-kilburn-votes-yes-1-6331125">in Oct 2019</a>.</p>

<p>There are no publicly available section 106 agreements for the consented phases so it is impossible to confirm whether the replacement ‘social’ housing will be social rent or affordable rent (up to 80% market rent).</p>

<p>Brent’s <a href="http://democracy.brent.gov.uk/documents/s60550/Improving%20the%20Housing%20Offer%20for%20Tenants%20and%20Leaseholders.pdf">leaseholder rehousing policy</a> (para 5.8.2) says that its shared equity rehousing offer to leaseholders requires them to invest their savings into their shared equity home.</p>

<p>This was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/16/government-blocks-controversial-plan-to-force-out-housing-estate-residents">deemed unlawful</a> by the Secretary of State at the 2015 Aylesbury estate CPO inquiry and required Southwark to <a href="http://moderngov.southwarksites.com/documents/s74901/Report%20Amending%20the%20shared%20equity%20rehousing%20policy%20for%20qualifying%20homeowners%20affected%20by%20regenerati.pdf">amend</a> its policy.</p>

<p>It is also a breach of the legal “principle of equivalence” which says that persons affected by compulsory purchase should be no worse off in financial terms after the acquisition.</p>

<p>The lack of a rehousing option for leaseholders which doesn’t leave them financially disadvantaged is a breach of section 233(5&amp;7) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, which requires that persons compulsorily removed from their homes for planning purposes are offered ‘suitable accommodation’ on the redeveloped land <em>‘on terms settled with due regard to the price at which any such land has been acquired from him’</em>.</p>
