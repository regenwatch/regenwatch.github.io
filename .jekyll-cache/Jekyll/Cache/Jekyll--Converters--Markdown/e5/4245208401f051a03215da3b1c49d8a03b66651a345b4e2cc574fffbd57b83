I"î<p>Circa 100 homes remain earmarked for demolition on Hackneyâ€™s Marian Court estate in Homerton.</p>

<p>Both Marian Court and the adjacent Brige House site have been <a href="https://hackney.gov.uk/bridge-house">earmarked for redevelopment</a> by Hackney Council in a joint venture with developer Austringer Capital.</p>

<p>The Mayorâ€™s May 2018 stage 1 planning report for the scheme says that his ballot requirement is not applicable because Hackney is not seeking grant funding.</p>

<p>However, the scheme is <a href="/approved/funding">listed</a> in the Mayorâ€™s funding register as having been subsequently awarded grant funding in November 2018.</p>
