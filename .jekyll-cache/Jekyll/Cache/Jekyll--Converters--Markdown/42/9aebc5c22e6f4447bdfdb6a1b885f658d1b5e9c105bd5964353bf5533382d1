I"²<p>264 homes are earmarked for demolition on Ealingâ€™s High Lane estate in Hanwell.</p>

<p>Located near the river Brent and Brent Valley Park, the estate comprises 264 homes in a mixture of two bed maisonettes and three bed flats, of which 51 households are leasehold owned.</p>

<p>In 2017, Ealing Council <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/14285/high_lane_estate_regeneration_-_selection_of_a_preferred_partner.pdf">resolved</a> to enter into a joint venture agreement with developer Rydon for the redevelopment of the estate.</p>

<p>In order to qualify for Mayoral funding, a ballot was held at the end of 2018 and the majority of those voting voted in favour of the councilâ€™s proposals.</p>

<p>A planning application was due to be submitted in March 2020 but as at June 2020 no application has been submitted.</p>

<p>Ealing says that tenants will have a right to return to the redeveloped estate and leaseholders too.
