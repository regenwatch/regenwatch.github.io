I"µ<p>363 of the 440 homes on Barnetâ€™s Dollis Valley estate are under threat of demolition. Whilst the low-rise terraced properties on the south side of the estate will be retained, all 363 of the 5-storey maisonette blocks on the north side will be demolished.</p>

<p>Phase 1 of the scheme is currently underway. The <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/public%3A//public%3A//PAWS/media_id_213093///dollis_valley_estate_report.pdf">GLA report</a> approving the scheme justifies the net loss of social rented housing as follows:</p>

<p>The scheme is being progressed in partnership with developer Countryside Properties, which has a dedicated website for the scheme: <a href="http://www.dollisvalley.co.uk/">www.dollisvalley.co.uk</a></p>

<p>There is no section 106 agreement publicly available to know whether the replacement â€˜socialâ€™ housing is affordable rent or social rent. The planning reference number for the application documents is <a href="https://publicaccess.barnet.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&amp;keyVal=ZZZULZJIJV526">B/00354/13</a></p>
