I"!<p>746 homes are earmarked for demolition on Enfield’s Alma estate at Ponders End.</p>

<p>7.8 hectares, Ponders End Railway Station - four high rise tower blocks (each 23 storeys), and a number of low rise maisonette and flatted blocks.</p>

<p>Enfield Council signed a joint-venture agreement with developer Countryside Properties for the redevelopment of the estate in November 2014.</p>

<p>The scheme is being <a href="/approved/funding">funded</a> by the Mayor and <a href="/approved/ballotexemptions">exempted</a> from his requirement to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes.</p>

<p>Phase one of the four stage scheme has been demolished and is nearing completion. Remaining phases are still occupied.</p>

<p>Outline planning permission was granted in September 2015 but subject to the signing of a section 106 agreement when the first detailed application came forward. In June 2017 a <a href="/images/almas106.pdf">section 106 agreement was signed</a> which guaranteed just 200 of the 993 replacement homes as social rent:</p>

<p>There is no provision on the redeveloped estate for the estate’s 170 current leaseholders. Enfield has no shared equity scheme - if leaseholders want to buy one of the new shared ownership homes they will have to pay rent on the unowned equity.</p>
