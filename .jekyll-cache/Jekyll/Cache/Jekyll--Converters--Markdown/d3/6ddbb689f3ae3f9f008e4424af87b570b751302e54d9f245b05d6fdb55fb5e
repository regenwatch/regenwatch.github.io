I"N<p>Circa 100 homes are earmarked for demolition on Dagenham’s Leys estate.</p>

<p>The Leys Estate is located in Dagenham, just south of Rainham Road,close to its junction with Ballards Road. The estate exists within a suburban context, and is surrounded by parkland and low density residential development. The redline boundary of the application relates to the western edge of the estate, which contains two main residential neighbourhoods: Birdbrook Close (proposed phase 1); and, Wellington Drive (proposed phase 2). 6The estate is south of Dagenham East Underground station, which is approximately one kilometre away.</p>

<p>Phase one of the scheme is nearing completion and involved demolition of around 100 of the estates 215 homes in 2015. Phase 2 of the scheme is still fully occupied and the formal decant process hasn’t yet started.</p>

<p>The overall redevelopment will provide 158 new homes - all of which at affordable rent (up to 80% market rent) and is being progressed by the Council in conjunction with its subsidiary affordable housing company <a href="https://www.lbbd.gov.uk/affordable-rents-reside-housing">Reside</a> which provides intermediate rented housing <em>“to people who are in employment, but can’t afford to buy or rent privately and have limited access to social housing”</em></p>

<p>The Council says that tenants wanting to return to the redeveloped site will pay ‘social’ rents and that the 5 current leaseholders will have the ‘Right to Return’ to the redeveloped site. But its <a href="https://modgov.lbbd.gov.uk/Internet/documents/s131918/Estate%20Renewal%20Report.pdf">rehousing policy</a> provides little detail on how this works in practice - it offers an ‘equity loan’ scheme but it is discretionary and dependent upon the size of the gap between the value of leaseholders’ current homes and the new ones proposed to be built.
