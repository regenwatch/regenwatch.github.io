I"f<p>In Sep 2019, the Mayor approved the demolition of 262 homes on Bexley’s Arthur Street estate - to be replaced by 320, with a net loss of 134 social rent and no right to return for tenants or leaseholders.</p>

<p>The Mayor’s <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/public%3A//public%3A//PAWS/media_id_473856///arthur_street_estate_report.pdf">planning report</a> approving the scheme, accepts the justification made for the net loss which is that affordable housing is being built on other sites in the borough.</p>

<p>The scheme is being progressed with Mayoral funding by Orbit Housing Association, which has managed the borough’s social housing portfolio since the stock transfer in 1998.</p>
