<p>241 homes on Camden’s Wendling estate have been <a href="https://www.camden.gov.uk/wendling-estate-and-st-stephens-close">earmarked for demolition</a> in an options appraisal involving 3 options: in-fill, partial redevelopment and full redevelopment.</p>

<p>In July 2019, the Council’s Cabinet <a href="http://democracy.camden.gov.uk/documents/s81826/12%20The%20Future%20of%20Wendling%20Estate.pdf">decided</a> that its preferred option is full redevelopment and resolved to ballot residents on this option.</p>

<p>The decision was the cause of some unrest among residents, reported in the local press (April 2020):

<p>The Wendling estate overlooks the site of the former Bacton estate where 100 council homes were demolished nearly 10 years ago. 67 new private and ‘affordable’ homes were completed on the adjacent ‘phase 1’ of that scheme in 2015 but in 2020 the main plot of the former estate remains an empty building site. This provides an instructive lesson for residents on the Wendling estate who will be wooed with promises of new homes ahead of the forthcoming ballot..</p>
