I"n<p>Circa 250 homes on Camden’s Juniper Crescent and Gilbey’s yard estates have been earmarked for redevelopment as part of the <a href="https://www.camden.gov.uk/documents/20142/145786127/Site+Allocations+2020+-+05+Camden+Goods+Yard.pdf">Camden Goods Yard regeneration</a></p>

<p>The neighbouring estates overlook the Regents Canal and are located between Camden Market and Camden Roundhouse.</p>

<p>In July 2019, housing association One Housing entered into a joint venture with developer Countryside Properties for the redevelopment of the estates.</p>

<p>One Housing had already started ‘decanting’ secure tenants by offering them rehousing in its existing stock elsewhere in the borough. It has filled the vacant homes with short-term intermediate rent tenants.</p>

<p>A ballot was supposed to be held by housing association One Housing Group in late March 2020, but this was <a href="https://onehousing.co.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/16319/Juniper-Crescent-and-Gilbeys-Yard-project-FAQs-2020.pdf">postponed</a> because of the coronavirus crisis. The ballot was postponed until 8th June and consultation sessions were <a href="https://onehousing.co.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/17416/Juniper-Crescent-and-Gilbeys-Yard-News-May-2020.pdf">instead carried out via zoom</a>:</p>

<p>Residents were told in the <a href="/images/juniperno.pdf">consultation documents</a> that if they vote against demolition in the ballot then their homes would only in future receive essential maintenance:</p>

<p>This is reiterated in the formal <a href="/images/juniperoffer.pdf">‘Landlord Offer’</a> to residents ahead of the ballot:</p>
