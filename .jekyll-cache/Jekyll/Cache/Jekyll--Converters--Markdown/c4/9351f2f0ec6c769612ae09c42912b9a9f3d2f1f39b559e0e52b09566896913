I"ð<p>Circa 150 homes of the 550 homes on RBKCâ€™s Wornington Green estate remain earmarked for demolition by Catalyst Housing Association, with stage 1 of 3 now complete.</p>

<p>Phase 1 of the scheme is complete and phase 2 is under construction. The â€˜decantingâ€™ of homes on phase 3 is due to commence in late 2020 as is the consultation period prior to submission of a planning application.</p>

<p>Catalystâ€™s <a href="https://www.chg.org.uk/development-regeneration/regeneration/wornington-green-kensington/">website</a> describes the replacement social housing as â€˜affordable rentâ€™:</p>
