    Community groups and residents associations have long fought for their rights to a fair treatment and this has resulted in  some important positive changes to policy. Below you find the most important policy documents, which pin down tenants and leaseholders rights to be treated with fairness and to not become the victims of enforced displacement.

          Better Homes for Local People - The Mayor of London’s Good Practice Guide to Estate Regeneration - A summary

        The London Mayor’s Better Homes for Local People, published in 2018,focuses on ensuring that tenants and residents have been properly consulted on regeneration proposals for their estates, that council / social housing is not being lost and tenants and leaseholders are not displaced in these schemes, which has often occurred across London. 

        
<p class="lead">Key points in the Mayor’s guidance are:</p>
        <ul>
		<li>Alternatives to demolition of social housing should always be considered first in estate regeneration schemes.</li>
		<li>If demolition is chosen, ‘affordable’ homes should at least be replaced on a like-for-like basis, and increased wherever possible. That means that new social rented homes should be the same rent levels as existing.</li>
		<li>Where the cost of this like-for-like replacement would make an estate regeneration scheme financially unviable, gap funding should be sought from the Greater London Authority (GLA).</li>
		<li>A ballot of tenants and residents is now a condition of funding from the GLA for estate regeneration schemes where demolition is proposed.</li>
		<li>In instances where demolition and replacement of existing homes occurs, social tenants should be guaranteed full rights to return (or to remain through a single move). Leaseholders and freeholders must be offered a fair deal.</li>
		<li>Tenants and residents must be at the heart of decisions about the ongoing management and the future of their estates. In respect of estate regeneration landlords must also seek to consult with private tenants, those living in temporary accommodation on the estate and non-resident leaseholders and freeholders.</li>
     <li>Councils and housing associations should also engage with Tenant and ResidentAssociations (TRAs), or similar resident representative bodies, where they exist.</li>
		<li>Consultation must be transparent, extensive, responsive (to the views of tenants and residents) and meaningful.</li>
		<li>Resident Charters,setting out landlord’s commitments to residents at an early stage of discussions can bean effective way to engage residents. Commitments in a charter should be clear, specific, deliverable, and written in accessible, non-technical language.</li>
		<li>Residents should be closely involved in shaping the estate regeneration priorities and options for achieving them. Options appraisals should be open and transparent. They should include technical and financial appraisals that have influenced any decisions on the options. They should also be set out in an accessible format with non-technical summaries. Any options that have been discounted (as unviable or undeliverable) should be made clear with a clear explanation of why.</li></ul>
