      <h1>The Research</h1>
      <p class="lead text-muted">Over the last 3 years, the University of Leicester and King’s College
London have undertaken a research project that has provided detailed evidence since 1997 of the displacement of London council tenants and leaseholders through regeneration schemes. As part of this research, 120 in-depth interviews were carried out with residents on 6 different council estates undergoing regeneration.</p>

        <h1>Case studies</h1>
        <p class="lead">124 interviews were conducted with households on 6 council estates across London. These interviews were carried out with current residents, as well as residents that had moved off the estate, and with some that moved off and then returned after regeneration. Interview questions focused on health and well-being and sought to understand how the regeneration of their estate impacted them. All estates had seen decanting, with residents describing households, friends and neighbours having moved off their estate. Interviewees across all estates raised concerns about affordability and the increase of market rate homes,the changing social character of the area, as well as a lack of clear information and poor management of the regeneration process.</p>

        <h2>Aylesbury estate</h2>
        <p class="lead">Key themes discussed in the interviews: 
	<ul class="lead">
		<li>Residents have experienced long term interference and disruption to services due to building works from the regeneration.</li>
		<li>Leaseholders express concern that will not be adequately compensated for their homes, meaning they therefore will be unable to afford homes on the estate or in the area after regeneration.</li>
		<li>There is a sense that South London as an area is experiencing gentrification pressure and that the area is likely to change for a different demographic of residents.</li>
		<li>It was often expressed that foreign investment drives the changes and this creates resentment.</li>
		<li>There is a fear for the future and shared opinion that the Council is intentionally displacing residents.</li>
		<li>The loss of the Heygate Estate and the displacement of its residents is referenced often and likely adds to these fears.</li></ul></p>

        <h2>Gascoigne estate</h2>
        <p class="lead">Key themes discussed in the interviews: 
	<ul class="lead">
		<li>Almost all interviewees expressed that there is a lack of clear and concise information from the Council about the regeneration of the estate, in particular providing clear timelines.</li>
		<li>Residents are unsure whether their homes were included in the plans for demolition and when they may have to move, creating a sense of apprehension and uncertainty for households.</li>
		<li>Residents living in the portion of already completed new-builds on the estate express that bills in these properties are more expensive.</li>
		<li>However, some residents were looking forward to changes on the estate and were looking forward to potentially getting a new-build home.</li>
		<li>There is a recognition that the borough is changing and attracting more affluent professional households.</li>
		<li>References are made to there being lots of new construction and developments in the borough, especially the Riverside Development site.</li></ul></p>

        <h2>Ocean estate</h2>
        <p class="lead">Key themes discussed in the interviews: 
	<ul class="lead">
		<li>The estate has seen a lot of demolition and new construction, with many households decanted from the original buildings and displaced from the area.</li>
		<li>Rent and bills in the new-build homes were more expensive than in the previous council homes.</li>
		<li>The move from a council property to a housing association meant that some residents had a change in their tenure, losing their ‘secure’ tenancy and becoming ‘assured’ tenure. Some residents had fought hard to retain their secure tenancies after moving into the new-builds.</li>
		<li>There were common concerns about the general affordability of the new-build housing on the estate and across East London.</li>
		<li>Leaseholders that were ‘bought out’ because of demolition of their homes found that the money offered to them didn’t allow for them to repurchase a home in the same area, and therefore leaseholders often moved out of the area and out of London all together into the fringes of Essex or further.</li>
		<li>The decanting process was very difficult on households, both financially and emotionally, causing stress and upheaval.</li>
		<li>Asian and Bangladeshi interviewees describe a sense that they were intentionally targeted to be moved, often describing social and ethnic cleansing.</li></ul></p>

	<ul class="lead">
		<li>Residents have seen several phases of regeneration and attempts to fight against it.</li>
		<li>Many expressed views that the estate was seeing a new type of resident in the area, noting that there are more young professionals and families moving in.</li>
		<li>Often referenced is the changing shops and businesses, including the new-build properties on the estate that feature additional commercial space. This is often referenced with regard to providing for the changing demographics.</li>
		<li>Aragon Tower (previously a council block, now privately owned) is a point of contention among residents and is frequently discussed as a loss of council homes on the estate.</li>
		<li>It is recognised by residents that the estate’s proximity to the River Thames is what makes it a desirable place to live, therefore adding to gentrification pressure with people moving to the area.</li>
		<li>In addition, the Convoys Wharf development is mentioned, this is adjacent to the estate and is under construction, and raises concerns among residents about its potential future impacts.</li></ul></p>
