			         <p class="lead text-muted" align="left">
				 Since he was elected Mayor in May 2016, Sadiq Khan has <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/list_of_exemptions.pdf">exempted</a> 44 estates from his requirement to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes and the estates that aren't exempted continue to contravene his ballot requirements.

The Mayor's <a href="/"> policy guidance</a> on ballots specifically says that refurbishment needs to be an option but he continues to turn a blind eye to what is becoming a common practice in the regeneration game.

For example, residents on the <a href="/estates/towerhamlets/clichyestate">Clichy estate in Tower Hamlets</a> residents were initially consulted on an 'infill' option as well as full redevelopment. But the <a href"https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/clichy_estate_ballot_paper_accom?nocache=incoming-1565802#incoming-1565802">information</a> sent to residents along with the ballot papers asked only whether they wanted full redevelopment or not.

<br>

In addition, leaseholders were <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/658746/response/1565802/attach/4/Ballot%20information%20requested%201.pdf">told</a> that if they voted against redevelopment then they would be faced with major bills for any refurbishment.
<br>
<br>
Finally, residents were told that if they don't vote for full redevelopment then they will likely be faced with the infill option anyway:

This follows Tower Hamlets' ballot of <a href="/estates/towerhamlets/teviot/">Teviot estate</a> where residents were told that given the option of leaving the estate in its current dilapidated state or fully redeveloping it or if they voted against they would face having new homes built on their roofs anyway:

Residents of the <a href="/estates/camden/westkentishtown">West Kentish Town estate</a> in Camden were told that if they voted against regeneration then their estate wouldn't see any major improvement for at least another 5 to 10 years:

Similarly, residents of the <a href="/estates/camden/junipercrescent">Juniper Crescent estate</a> in Camden were told that their estate would only receive essential maintenance and repairs as reported if they voted no:

Residents on the St Raphael's estate in Brent were told that if they voted against demolition then their homes wouldn't be improved beyond their current condition:

Residents on the <a href="/estates/barnet/douglasbaderpark">Douglas Bader Park estate</a> were faced with a similar ultimatum:

This is a recurring element when it comes to estate regeneration ballots; residents are faced with the choice of promises of brand new homes or facing many more years of neglect and only essential maintenance. 


This, coupled with incentives to tenants like the offer of an extra bedroom if they are overoccupying or offers of secure tenancies to temporary tenants (many secure tenants having already been rehoused) has become a winning formula for Councils and housing associations looking to gain support for demolition.  
<br><br>
Notwithstanding this, the Mayor has <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/list_of_exemptions.pdf">exempted</a> 44 estates from having to comply with his ballot requirement in the first place:</p>
