				 The obligation to rehouse tenants and homeowners in estate regeneration schemes is enshrined within the general legal _“principle of equivalence”_ which says that persons affected by compulsory purchase should be no worse off in financial terms after the compulsory acquisition and <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/8/section/233">section 233(paras 5 & 7) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990</a>, which says that persons compulsorily removed from their homes for planning purposes must be offered 'suitable accommodation' on the redeveloped land _'on terms settled with due regard to the price at which any such land has been acquired from him'_.

				 Despite this legal obligation, all that the Mayor's <a href="">Estate Regeneration Policy</a> says is that tenants and leaseholders must be offered a 'fair deal'
