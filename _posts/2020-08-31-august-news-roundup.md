Wandsworth Council leader, Ravi Govindia issued a statement [indicating](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/house-builder-backs-out-of-1000-home-regeneration-scheme-67431) that the Council is exploring other options for proceeding with the scheme:

_“Despite these unprecedented times, the council remains completely committed to delivering the transformational regeneration the residents of the Alton Estate expect and deserve. We will be exploring options as to how to deliver the scheme without Redrow and to maintain momentum subject to planning permission being granted."_

Residents [speaking out](https://www.mylondon.news/news/south-london-news/were-exhausted-people-waiting-15-18795297) on the decision want to see a community-based plan _" more of a focus on refurbishment, and small-scale development with more social housing.". 

Leonie Cooper, London Assembly member for Wandsworth, has [issued a statement](https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/assembly/leonie-cooper/redrow-withdrawal-from-alton-estate-regeneration) questioning whether demolition is the right way forward - _"Given the Council has now declared a Climate Emergency, it should first start by considering whether demolition and reconstruction is the best way ahead at all"_.
