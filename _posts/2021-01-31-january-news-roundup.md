In our last [roundup](https://estatewatch.london/november-news-roundup/) we reported on a number of planning applications submitted in the run up to Christmas. We also reported on the Mayor's recent announcement that his next round of grant funding will no longer fund replacement homes in estate demolition schemes. The current pace of planning application submissions may suggest that schemes are being hurried through before the change in grant funding, which requires a start on site before the end of March next year.

The New Year has seen yet another major application submitted, this time for the demolition of Ealing's High Lane estate.

<img src="https://estatewatch.london/images/highlane3.jpg" width="50%" class="img-fluid rounded img-thumbnail">

The application submitted by Ealing's development partner Rydon proposes demolition of all 264 homes on the High Lane estate and replacement with 505 homes, of which just 142 social rent. 


The planning application's [supporting documents](https://pam.ealing.gov.uk/online-applications/files/215D963AA11B3A1D76601F0EF5101378/pdf/210009OUT-2020.12.17_FINAL_AFFORDABLE_HOUSING_STATEMENT-3542754.pdf) say that these will be let as council homes, but they will incur a 'new build supplement' of £20pw above the Council's current social rent levels. 

<img src="/images/highlanesr.png" class="img-fluid rounded img-thumbnail">

The application also proposes 75 homes at London Affordable Rent and 10 shared equity homes (for the estate's leaseholders) and 278 private market homes.

We note that the proposed tenure mix is different from the tenure mix presented in Ealing's formal [Landlord Offer](http://estatewatch.london/images/highlaneoffer.pdf) to residents at the time of the ballot, with an extra 44 homes proposed in total, most of which (36) are private sale units.

<img src="/images/highlanetm.png" class="img-fluid rounded img-thumbnail">

This raises a question about the integrity of the Mayor's ballot requirement. The Mayor's [policy on ballots](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/gla_cfg_section_8._resident_ballots_-_18_july_2018.pdf) is clear that he may terminate funding for schemes, which have deviated from the original tenure mix that residents were balloted on (see para 8.7.3). It remains to be seen whether the Mayor will pick this up or take any action.

Another point worth noting is that the application proposes just 10 shared equity homes when there are 51 leaseholders on the estate. Perhaps the reason for expecting such a low take up is that Ealing's [shared equity offer to leaseholders](https://ealing.cmis.uk.com/ealing/Document.ashx?czJKcaeAi5tUFL1DTL2UE4zNRBcoShgo=orv9zlc1hcwmefvl%2FzC77iPz0uNaQowGhPWmce8m8fB%2FMzqMI5BQBA%3D%3D&rUzwRPf%2BZ3zd4E7Ikn8Lyw%3D%3D=pwRE6AGJFLDNlh225F5QMaQWCtPHwdhUfCZ%2FLUQzgA2uL5jNRG4jdQ%3D%3D&mCTIbCubSFfXsDGW9IXnlg%3D%3D=hFflUdN3100%3D&kCx1AnS9%2FpWZQ40DXFvdEw%3D%3D=hFflUdN3100%3D&uJovDxwdjMPoYv%2BAJvYtyA%3D%3D=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&FgPlIEJYlotS%2BYGoBi5olA%3D%3D=NHdURQburHA%3D&d9Qjj0ag1Pd993jsyOJqFvmyB7X0CSQK=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&WGewmoAfeNR9xqBux0r1Q8Za60lavYmz=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&WGewmoAfeNQ16B2MHuCpMRKZMwaG1PaO=ctNJFf55vVA%3D) requires them to invest their personal savings and take out a mortgage if they want to take up the offer (see para 2.2). This was [deemed unlawful](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/16/government-blocks-controversial-plan-to-force-out-housing-estate-residents) by the Secretary of State at the 2015 Aylesbury estate CPO inquiry and required Southwark to [amend](http://moderngov.southwarksites.com/documents/s74901/Report%20Amending%20the%20shared%20equity%20rehousing%20policy%20for%20qualifying%20homeowners%20affected%20by%20regenerati.pdf) its policy.

As with the estate demolition applications submitted before Christmas, this application fails to comply with the Mayor’s requirement to explore alternatives to demolition. It is therefore impossible to know whether the £23M that Ealing Council is spending on the scheme would be better spent on refurbishment - (see para 3.4.7 of [this Council report](https://ealing.cmis.uk.com/ealing/Document.ashx?czJKcaeAi5tUFL1DTL2UE4zNRBcoShgo=T29KJkkv6%2B%2FEOf%2F4pv0XwtQAUSiI7enW%2FlmOaGncZVyUQOQgHSXqXw%3D%3D&rUzwRPf%2BZ3zd4E7Ikn8Lyw%3D%3D=pwRE6AGJFLDNlh225F5QMaQWCtPHwdhUfCZ%2FLUQzgA2uL5jNRG4jdQ%3D%3D&mCTIbCubSFfXsDGW9IXnlg%3D%3D=hFflUdN3100%3D&kCx1AnS9%2FpWZQ40DXFvdEw%3D%3D=hFflUdN3100%3D&uJovDxwdjMPoYv%2BAJvYtyA%3D%3D=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&FgPlIEJYlotS%2BYGoBi5olA%3D%3D=NHdURQburHA%3D&d9Qjj0ag1Pd993jsyOJqFvmyB7X0CSQK=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&WGewmoAfeNR9xqBux0r1Q8Za60lavYmz=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&WGewmoAfeNQ16B2MHuCpMRKZMwaG1PaO=ctNJFf55vVA%3D) for scheme costs.

Rydon has also failed to publish its viability assessment for the application so it is impossible to know whether the maximum amount of affordable housing is beieng provided. Since 2018, making viability assessments public has been another one of the Mayor's policy requirements which is being routinely ignored by developers and local authorities.

You can view the planning application documents on Ealing's planning portal [here](https://pam.ealing.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=QMEOPIJM0GW00) or read more about the High Lane estate on our web page [here.](https://estatewatch.london/estates/ealing/highlane/)

## Geoffrey Close estate
Last month, the Mayor published his [stage 1 planning report](https://gla.force.com/pr/s/planning-application/a0i4J000002TXIGQA4/20206691?tabset-c2f3b=2) for [Riverside Housing Association](https://www.riverside.org.uk/)'s demolition of Lambeth's [Geoffrey Close estate](https://estatewatch.london/estates/lambeth/geoffreyclose/) off Coldharbour Lane. Riverside applied to demolish the estate's 134 homes in November last year and replace them with 441 homes of which just 135 social rent. 

<img src="https://estatewatch.london/images/cle8.jpg" width="50%" class="img-fluid rounded img-thumbnail">

The report is critical of Riverside's proposal to gate the entire development (para 39) and failure to re-provide the ball court (para 43). It also criticises the uplift of just one social rented home, despite a near fourfold increase in the total number of homes - _"It is disappointing that, given the significant uplift in housing across the site, the uplift in affordable housing is just one unit."_ (para 49) 

The report also takes issue with Riverside's failure to consider alternatives to demolition (para 31) and has requested more information to be submitted, but it is otherwise silent on the application's failure to meet the Mayor's key policy requirement of min 50% affordable housing, which applies to all estate redevelopments. 

Interestingly, the report does raise the issue that residents were balloted on a different tenure mix to that now being proposed (para 30). 

The tenure mix in Riverside's [Landlord Offer](http://estatewatch.london/images/geoffreycloseoffer.pdf) to residents at the time of the ballot was as follows:

<img src="/images/roffer.png" class="img-fluid rounded img-thumbnail">

But the tenure mix proposed in its planning application includes an extra 43 homes in total, while reducing the number of social rented habitable rooms by 44 to 431 and increasing the number of market sale habitable rooms by 72 to 781. 

While it is good to see the Mayor's planning report pick this up, it is disappointing to see that the Mayor proposes to take no action. The Mayor has provisionally granted £10M funding to this scheme. He ought to be using this leverage to ensure it complies with his basic policy requirements, not just on ballots and affordable housing tenure mix, but also on the more fundamental question of whether these buildings need to be demolished in the first place. 

You can view the Mayor's report [here](https://gla.force.com/pr/s/planning-application/a0i4J000002TXIGQA4/20206691?tabset-c2f3b=2), the full planning application documents (except the financial viability assessment which hasn't been published) on Lambeth's planning portal [here](https://planning.lambeth.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=QHD9R4BO08M00) and our web page about the Geoffrey Close estate [here](https://estatewatch.london/estates/lambeth/geoffreyclose/).

## Grahame Park estate
An [FOI request](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/affordable_housing_funding_annua) has revealed that housing association [Notting Hill Genesis](https://www.nhg.org.uk) charged higher rents than it was supposed to for replacement social housing on the Grahame Park estate - in breach of both funding conditions and the planning permission.

A compliance audit by the GLA found that on first let, Notting Hill had charged nearly £20 per week more than the Mayor's permitted benchmark levels for London Affordable Rent. 

<img src="http://35percent.org/img/gparkaudit2.png" width="50%" class="img-fluid rounded img-thumbnail">  

The audit makes no mention of the fact that the planning permission envisaged the tenure of these homes to be social rent, which is even lower than the Mayor's London Affordable Rent benchmark levels. 

This is because the [scope of the audit](https://www.london.gov.uk/file/46480) is limited only to verifying that rents are in line with grant funding conditions on first let. The Mayor's audit is not concerned with rent levels on subsequent lets or whether the rents are in line with the tenure required by the planning consent. 

<img src="http://35percent.org/img/glachecklist.jpg" width="50%" class="img-fluid rounded img-thumbnail">

Details of the planning consent for the phase in question are available on Barnet's planning portal [here](https://publicaccess.barnet.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=NEVAH5JIFWV00) and details of the Mayor's annual compliance audit are available on the GLA website [here](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/11_gla_cfg_section_9._compliance_audit_-_august_2020.pdf)

## Sian Berry report
London Assembly member Sian Berry has published a [report](https://www.sianberry.london/news/housing/13500-lost-and-counting-we-cant-go-on-knocking-down-council-homes/) showing that a staggering 6,748 council and housing association homes have been lost to estate demolition since 2003. 

The report is based on an analysis of the GLA's London Development Database and gives a breakdown of the figures by borough. In addition, it shows that another 6,791 homes are due to be demolished within the current pipeline.
