title: JANUARY NEWS ROUND-UP
date: 2021-01-31

In last month's [roundup](https://estatewatch.london/november-news-roundup/) we reported a flurry of planning applications submitted in the run up to Christmas. The New Year has seen another major application submitted - that for the redevelopment of Ealing's High Lane estate.

The application submitted by Ealing's development partner Rydon on 16th December (but not validated until 4th Jan) proposes demolition of the estate's 264 homes and replacement with 505 homes, of which 142 social rent.

However, the devil in the detail of the planning application's [supporting documents](https://pam.ealing.gov.uk/online-applications/files/215D963AA11B3A1D76601F0EF5101378/pdf/210009OUT-2020.12.17_FINAL_AFFORDABLE_HOUSING_STATEMENT-3542754.pdf) shows that these will incur a 'new build supplement' of £20pw above the Council's current council rents.

As with all the other estate regeneration applications submitted before Christmas, this application fails the Mayor’s requirement to explore alternatives to demolition, which is enshrined both in the Mayor’s Estate Regeneration Guidance and the new London Plan.

This is all the more important for schemes like this where Ealing is contributing a significant sum of public funds to the scheme - £23M according to [council figures](https://ealing.cmis.uk.com/ealing/Document.ashx?czJKcaeAi5tUFL1DTL2UE4zNRBcoShgo=T29KJkkv6%2B%2FEOf%2F4pv0XwtQAUSiI7enW%2FlmOaGncZVyUQOQgHSXqXw%3D%3D&rUzwRPf%2BZ3zd4E7Ikn8Lyw%3D%3D=pwRE6AGJFLDNlh225F5QMaQWCtPHwdhUfCZ%2FLUQzgA2uL5jNRG4jdQ%3D%3D&mCTIbCubSFfXsDGW9IXnlg%3D%3D=hFflUdN3100%3D&kCx1AnS9%2FpWZQ40DXFvdEw%3D%3D=hFflUdN3100%3D&uJovDxwdjMPoYv%2BAJvYtyA%3D%3D=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&FgPlIEJYlotS%2BYGoBi5olA%3D%3D=NHdURQburHA%3D&d9Qjj0ag1Pd993jsyOJqFvmyB7X0CSQK=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&WGewmoAfeNR9xqBux0r1Q8Za60lavYmz=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&WGewmoAfeNQ16B2MHuCpMRKZMwaG1PaO=ctNJFf55vVA%3D).

Rydon has also failed to publish its viability assessment for the application, showing that it is providing the maximum viable amount of affordable housing. Since 2018, making viability assessments public has been another one of the Mayor's policy requirements which is being routinely ignored by developers and local authorities.

You can view the planning application documents on Ealing's planning portal [here](https://pam.ealing.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=QMEOPIJM0GW00) or read more about the estate on our web page [here.](https://estatewatch.london/estates/ealing/highlane/)

## Geoffrey Close estate
Last month, the Mayor published his [stage 1 report](https://gla.force.com/pr/s/planning-application/a0i4J000002TXIGQA4/20206691?tabset-c2f3b=2) for Riverside Housing Association's demolition of Lambeth's Geoffrey Close estate off Coldharbour Lane.

The report is critical of Riverside's proposal to gate the entire development (para 39) and failure to re-provide the ball court (para 43). It also criticises the increase the number of social rented homes by just one unit despite a near fourfold increase in the total number of homes - _"It is disappointing that, given the significant uplift in housing across the site, the uplift in affordable housing is just one unit."_ (para 49) 

It does take issue with the failure to consider alternatives to demolition (para 31) and has requested more information on this, but the report is otherwise silent on the application's failure to meet the Mayor's key policy requirement of min 50% affordable housing on estate redevelopments. 

One interesting point raised in the report rightly points out that residents were balloted on a different tenure mix to that now proposed. 

<img src="/images/gclosestage1.png" class="img-fluid rounded img-thumbnail">

It is disappointing to see the Mayor's report then gloss over this discrepancy, accepting Riverside's justification that it has subsequently 'consulted' residents on the tenure change. Especially so given that the Mayor has allocated nearly £10M funding to the reprovision of the 134 social rented homes being replaced.  

You can view the Mayor's report [here](https://gla.force.com/pr/s/planning-application/a0i4J000002TXIGQA4/20206691?tabset-c2f3b=2), the full planning application documents (except the financial viability assessment which hasn't been published) on Lambeth's planning portal [here](https://planning.lambeth.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=QHD9R4BO08M00) and our web page about the Geoffrey Close estate [here](https://estatewatch.london/estates/lambeth/geoffreyclose/).

## Grahame Park estate
An [FOI request](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/affordable_housing_funding_annua) has revealed that housing association [Notting Hill Genesis](https://www.nhg.org.uk) charged higher rents than it was supposed to for the replacement social housing on the Grahame Park estate - in breach of both funding conditions and the planning permission.

A compliance audit by the GLA found that on first let, Notting Hill had charged nearly £20 per week more than the Mayor's permitted benchmark levels for London Affordable Rent. 

<img src="http://35percent.org/img/gparkaudit2.png" class="img-fluid rounded img-thumbnail">  

The audit makes no mention of the fact that the planning permission envisaged the tenure of these homes to be social rent, which is even lower than the Mayor's London Affordable Rent benchmark levels. 

This is because the scope of the audit is limited only to verifying that rents are in line with grant funding conditions on first let. The Mayor's audit is not concerned with rent levels on subsequent lets or whether the rents are in line with the tenure required by the planning consent.

Details of the planning consent for the phase in question are available on Barnet's planning portal [here](https://publicaccess.barnet.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=NEVAH5JIFWV00) and details of the Mayor's annual compliance audit are available on the GLA website [here](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/11_gla_cfg_section_9._compliance_audit_-_august_2020.pdf)

## Sian Berry report
London Assembly member Sian Berry has published a [report](https://www.sianberry.london/news/housing/13500-lost-and-counting-we-cant-go-on-knocking-down-council-homes/) showing that a staggering 6,748 council and housing association homes have been lost to estate demolition since 2003. 

The report is based on an analysis of the GLA's London Development Database and gives a breakdown of the figures by borough. In addition, it shows that another 6,791 homes are due to be demolished within the current pipeline.
