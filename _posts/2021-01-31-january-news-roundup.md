In our last [roundup](https://estatewatch.london/november-news-roundup/) we reported on a number of planning applications submitted in the run up to Christmas. We also reported on the Mayor's recent announcement that his next round of grant funding will no longer fund replacement homes in estate demolition schemes. The current pace of planning application submissions may suggest that schemes are being hurried through before the change in grant funding, which requires a start on site before the end of March next year.

The New Year has seen yet another major application submitted, this time for the demolition of Ealing's High Lane estate.

The application submitted by Ealing's development partner Rydon proposes demolition of all 264 homes on the High Lane estate and replacement with 505 homes, of which 142 social rent.

However, the devil in the detail of the planning application's [supporting documents](https://pam.ealing.gov.uk/online-applications/files/215D963AA11B3A1D76601F0EF5101378/pdf/210009OUT-2020.12.17_FINAL_AFFORDABLE_HOUSING_STATEMENT-3542754.pdf) shows that these will incur a 'new build supplement' of £20pw above the Council's current council rents.

As with the estate demolition applications submitted before Christmas, this application fails to comply with the Mayor’s requirement to explore alternatives to demolition. This is all the more important for schemes like this where Ealing is contributing a significant sum of public funds to the scheme - £23M according to [council figures](https://ealing.cmis.uk.com/ealing/Document.ashx?czJKcaeAi5tUFL1DTL2UE4zNRBcoShgo=T29KJkkv6%2B%2FEOf%2F4pv0XwtQAUSiI7enW%2FlmOaGncZVyUQOQgHSXqXw%3D%3D&rUzwRPf%2BZ3zd4E7Ikn8Lyw%3D%3D=pwRE6AGJFLDNlh225F5QMaQWCtPHwdhUfCZ%2FLUQzgA2uL5jNRG4jdQ%3D%3D&mCTIbCubSFfXsDGW9IXnlg%3D%3D=hFflUdN3100%3D&kCx1AnS9%2FpWZQ40DXFvdEw%3D%3D=hFflUdN3100%3D&uJovDxwdjMPoYv%2BAJvYtyA%3D%3D=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&FgPlIEJYlotS%2BYGoBi5olA%3D%3D=NHdURQburHA%3D&d9Qjj0ag1Pd993jsyOJqFvmyB7X0CSQK=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&WGewmoAfeNR9xqBux0r1Q8Za60lavYmz=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&WGewmoAfeNQ16B2MHuCpMRKZMwaG1PaO=ctNJFf55vVA%3D).

Rydon has also failed to publish its viability assessment for the application, showing evidence that it is providing the maximum viable amount of affordable housing. Since 2018, making viability assessments public has been another one of the Mayor's policy requirements which is being routinely ignored by developers and local authorities.

You can view the planning application documents on Ealing's planning portal [here](https://pam.ealing.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=QMEOPIJM0GW00) or read more about the High Lane estate on our web page [here.](https://estatewatch.london/estates/ealing/highlane/)

## Geoffrey Close estate
Last month, the Mayor published his [stage 1 planning report](https://gla.force.com/pr/s/planning-application/a0i4J000002TXIGQA4/20206691?tabset-c2f3b=2) for Riverside Housing Association's demolition of Lambeth's Geoffrey Close estate off Coldharbour Lane. Riverside applied to demolish the estate's 134 homes in November last year and replace them with 441 homes of which just 135 social rent.

The report is critical of Riverside's proposal to gate the entire development (para 39) and failure to re-provide the ball court (para 43). It also criticises the uplift of just one social rented home despite a near fourfold increase in the total number of homes - _"It is disappointing that, given the significant uplift in housing across the site, the uplift in affordable housing is just one unit."_ (para 49) 

The report also takes issue with Riverside's failure to consider alternatives to demolition (para 31) and has requested more information to be submitted, but it is otherwise silent on the application's failure to meet the Mayor's key policy requirement of min 50% affordable housing, which applies to estate redevelopment. 

Another interesting point raised in the report points out that residents were balloted on a different tenure mix to that now proposed. 

<img src="/images/gclosestage1.png" width="50%" class="img-fluid rounded img-thumbnail">

Disappointingly this is then glossed over by Riverside's justification that it has subsequently consulted residents on the tenure change. With £10M GLA grant funding provisionally allocated to this scheme, it is disappointing to see the Mayor climb down on this and his other key policy requirements.   

You can view the Mayor's report [here](https://gla.force.com/pr/s/planning-application/a0i4J000002TXIGQA4/20206691?tabset-c2f3b=2), the full planning application documents (except the financial viability assessment which hasn't been published) on Lambeth's planning portal [here](https://planning.lambeth.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=QHD9R4BO08M00) and our web page about the Geoffrey Close estate [here](https://estatewatch.london/estates/lambeth/geoffreyclose/).

## Grahame Park estate
An [FOI request](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/affordable_housing_funding_annua) has revealed that housing association [Notting Hill Genesis](https://www.nhg.org.uk) charged higher rents than it was supposed to for replacement social housing on the Grahame Park estate - in breach of both funding conditions and the planning permission.

A compliance audit by the GLA found that on first let, Notting Hill had charged nearly £20 per week more than the Mayor's permitted benchmark levels for London Affordable Rent. 

<img src="http://35percent.org/img/gparkaudit2.png" width="50%" class="img-fluid rounded img-thumbnail">  

The audit makes no mention of the fact that the planning permission envisaged the tenure of these homes to be social rent, which is even lower than the Mayor's London Affordable Rent benchmark levels. 

This is because the scope of the audit is limited only to verifying that rents are in line with grant funding conditions on first let. The Mayor's audit is not concerned with rent levels on subsequent lets or whether the rents are in line with the tenure required by the planning consent.

Details of the planning consent for the phase in question are available on Barnet's planning portal [here](https://publicaccess.barnet.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=NEVAH5JIFWV00) and details of the Mayor's annual compliance audit are available on the GLA website [here](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/11_gla_cfg_section_9._compliance_audit_-_august_2020.pdf)

## Sian Berry report
London Assembly member Sian Berry has published a [report](https://www.sianberry.london/news/housing/13500-lost-and-counting-we-cant-go-on-knocking-down-council-homes/) showing that a staggering 6,748 council and housing association homes have been lost to estate demolition since 2003. 

The report is based on an analysis of the GLA's London Development Database and gives a breakdown of the figures by borough. In addition, it shows that another 6,791 homes are due to be demolished within the current pipeline.
