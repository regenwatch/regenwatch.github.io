Here is our brief round up of estate regeneration news for September and October. Many thanks to everyone who got in touch to let us know what is going on with their estates.

## GLA removes exemptions for Lambeth demolitions
Lambeth's [plans to raze six of its housing estates](https://estatewatch.london/underthreat/lambeth/) are up in the air, after it emerged that City Hall funding has been withdrawn for three major schemes ([Fenwick estate](https://estatewatch.london/estates/lambeth/fenwick/), [Westbury estate](https://estatewatch.london/estates/lambeth/westbury/) and [Cressingham Gardens](https://estatewatch.london/estates/lambeth/cressingham/)).

<img src="http://estatewatch.london/images/lambethestates.png" class="img-fluid rounded img-thumbnail">

The news was revealed by an [FOI request](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/cressingham_gardens_3?nocache=incoming-1639570#incoming-1639570) a letter from Deputy Mayor Tom Copley. The letter is reported to confirm that all residents must now be balloted as a condition of any new funding deal.

Meanwhile, Cressingham residents have championed their own alternative proposal for the estate. The [People’s Plan](http://cressinghampeoplesplan.org.uk), drawn up in 2016 with local architect Variant Office, includes refurbishing the existing homes and building 33 new homes for social rent. A [survey](http://cressinghampeoplesplan.org.uk/docs/TPP.pdf) of residents by the Cressingham People’s Plan found that 86% want refurbishment and only 4% want demolition.

According to [reports](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/gla-funding-withdrawn-for-three-major-council-estate-regeneration-schemes-68045) from Inside Housing Magazine, Lambeth Council intends to proceed with at least one of the estates (Westbury estate) using its own funding from Right to Buy receipts. 

The Mayor's [ballot requirement](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/housing-and-land/improving-quality/estate-regeneration) only requires ballots for estates applying for GLA funding. By avoiding applying for funding Lambeth is able to avoid having to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes. 


## Ebury Bridge estate
Westminster Council is also using this loophole and avoiding having to ballot residents on its [Ebury Bridge estate](https://estatewatch.london/estates/westminster/eburybridge/) by not applying for GLA funding.

Technically, the Mayor's London Plan [Policy 3.12 (Section A, sub-section [g])](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan/current-london-plan/london-plan-chapter-3/policy-312-negotiating) requires all schemes to seek the maximum viable amount of affordable housing and take into account any grant funding available.

All eyes will be on the Mayor as the final decision to approve the application or call it in lies with him. In the meantime, objections to Westminster's proposals can be submitted directly to the Mayor using the GLA's new [online comment submission form](https://gla.force.com/pr/s/planning-application/a0i4J000002RmHdQAK/20206100?tabset-c2f3b=3).

The Ebury estate regeneration is the first scheme undertaken by [Westminster's new Council-owned investment vehicle](https://www.westminster.gov.uk/council-launches-its-own-development-vehicle) and perhaps the first of many more such schemes to come. It will be up to the Mayor to decide whether he allows the Ebury Bridge scheme to set a precedent. 

## Alton estate 
Wandsworth Council is also using the funding loophole to avoid balloting residents of the [Alton estate](https://estatewatch.london/estates/wandsworth/altonarea/) on the demolition of their homes. 

In August, we [reported](https://estatewatch.london/august-news-roundup/) that the Alton estate plans were in trouble, after the Council's development partner pulled out. Despite this, Wandsworth Council vowed to press on with the scheme whilst it sought a new partner and last week, the Council granted itself planning permission.

This is in spite of the Mayor's concerns laid out in his [stage 1 response](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/public%3A//public%3A//PAWS/media_id_471293///alton_estate_report.pdf) to the planning application. These highlighted concerns about lack of consultation (para 36), quantum and rent levels of replacement 'social housing' (para 27) and the failure to apply for grant funding (para 39) and the failure to explore alternatives to demolition (para 20).

The requirement for the demolition of housing estates only to be considered as a last resort, is enshrined both in the Mayor's [Estate Regeneration Guidance](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/better-homes-for-local-people-the-mayors-good-practice-guide-to-estate-regeneration.pdf) and the [London Plan itself](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/intend_to_publish_-_clean.pdf):

All eyes are now on the Mayor, who has the power to 'call-in' Wandsworth's application. This will be a test of the Mayor's will to tackle Council's that evade his ballot requirement and who fail to weigh demolition against the significant [environmental, social and economic benefits of refurbishment](http://estatewatch.london/refurbishment). You can let the Mayor know what you think of Alton's proposals, by submitting a comment on the GLA's new planning portal using [this link](https://gla.force.com/pr/s/planning-application/a0i4J0000003TcJQAU/20194302s1?tabset-c2f3b=3).

In the meantime, estate residents have been [getting organised](https://twitter.com/AltonAction/status/1322956962439507971) and have received funding to co-produce an alternative Community Plan, exploring alternatives to demolition assisted by a group of researchers from [University College London](www.ucl.ac.uk) and the [Just Space network](www.justspace.org.uk).

## Wornington Word
Residents of RBKC's Wornington Green estate have released a documentary about the regeneration of the estate. 

The documentary 'Wornington Word' stems from a [project](https://worningtonword.renegadetheatre.co.uk/) to record oral histories of residents' experiences and funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund.

Phase 1 of the Wornington Green estate is complete and phase 2 is under construction. The ‘decanting’ of the remaining 150 homes on phase 3 is due to commence in late 2020, as is the consultation period prior to submission of a planning application.

## Retrofit 
In October, RIBA held a virtual conference in conjunction with the Institute of Government as part of the Conservative Party's fringe conference. 

The conference discussed ways of meeting the government's new target of net zero carbon development by 2030. Professor Gary Clark, Chair of RIBA's Sustainable Futures Group outlined the principles of RIBA's new [Sustainable Outcomes Guide](https://www.architecture.com/-/media/GatherContent/Test-resources-page/Additional-Documents/RIBASustainableOutcomesGuide2019pdf.pdf), which recognises the huge impact of embodied carbon and prioritises the retrofit of existing buildings before any new-build is considered. Retrofitting existing buildings is the first of RIBA's key design principles, which it is lobbying to be incorporated into regulations in the form of a sustainable design code.

Profeessor Clark was followed by Alexandra Willey, Clarion housing association's Head of Regeneration. Alexandra re-iterated the need for retrofit and talked about the group's retrofit plans for existing stock, as well as its recently becoming the first housing association to be awarded the [Sustainable Housing Label](http://www.clarionhg.com/news-research/2019/november/clarion-to-adopt-sustainable-housing-label/).

Alexandra's claims may upset some residents of the 1,300 homes across four London estates which Clarion has earmarked for demolition, without considering retrofit or balloting residents..
