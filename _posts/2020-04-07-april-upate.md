title: April update - Clichy estate residents balloted on the future of their homes. 
---
Ballot papers have been sent to 'eligible' residents on Stepney's Clichy estate in Tower Hamlets. The ballot is asking residents to choose between three options for the future of their estate; 

1. Full redevelopment
2. Partial redevelopment
3. In-fill

Last month we report that three more estates have been added to the watch list after the borugh of Buckminster published its draft local plan. 

January saw us getting ready to launch the web portal. February has seen us starting the research and also we've been busy doing x, y and z. 

Here's a sample image:
