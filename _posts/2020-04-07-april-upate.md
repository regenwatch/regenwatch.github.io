title: Clichy estate ballot goes ahead despite cancelled consultation. 
---
Ballot papers have been sent to 'eligible' residents on Stepney's [Clichy estate](https://estatewatch.github.io/estates/towerhamlets/clichyestate/) despite the consultation on future options for their homes having been cancelled due to the Coronavirus crisis.

The ballot paper [asked](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/clichy_estate_ballot_paper_accom?nocache=incoming-1565802#incoming-1565802) residents to choose between three options for the future of their estate; 

1. Full redevelopment
2. Partial redevelopment
3. In-fill

Noticeably absent from the options is the option of refurbishment or do-nothing.

The ballot went ahead [despite the face-to-face consultation sessions being cancelled due to the Coronavirus](https://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/lgnl/council_and_democracy/consultations/Housing-consultations/HAP_Houses.aspx):

Furthermore, in the [info pack](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/clichy_estate_ballot_paper_accom?nocache=incoming-1565802#incoming-1565802) sent to residents with the ballot papers, leaseholders were [told](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/658746/response/1565802/attach/4/Ballot%20information%20requested%201.pdf) if they voted against redevelopment then they would be faced with major bills and residents were told that if they don't vote for full redevelopment then they will likely be faced with the infill option option anyway:

This follows Tower Hamlets' ballot of Teviot estate residents where they [weren't asked if they wanted regeneration in the first place](https://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/news/politics/teviot-housing-estate-regeneration-voted-1-6052355).

Similar choices were faced by residents of the West Kentish Town estate in Camden:

Brent Council's [infopack](/images/st-raphaels-faq.pdf) (distributed to residents in Dec 2019 ahead of the ballot) makes it clear that if infill is the preferred option then their estate may also not receive any investment for improving current housing conditions:

This becoming a common element when it comes to estate regeneration ballots. Residents are being forced to opt between several .... alternatives, with refurbishment or scheduled maintenance as usual not being presented as an option. The Mayor's policy guidance specifically says that xxx needs to be an option but it would appear he is turning a blind eye... bla bla..
