The ballot is asking residents to choose between three options for the future of their estate; 

1. Full redevelopment
2. Partial redevelopment
3. In-fill

The ballot is set to go ahead [despite the face-to-face consultation sessions being cancelled due to the Coronavirus](https://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/lgnl/council_and_democracy/consultations/Housing-consultations/HAP_Houses.aspx):
