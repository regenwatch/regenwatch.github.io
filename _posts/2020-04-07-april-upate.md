Ballot papers have been sent to 'eligible' residents on Stepney's [Clichy estate](https://estatewatch.github.io/estates/towerhamlets/clichyestate/) despite the consultation on future options for their homes having been cancelled due to the Coronavirus crisis.

The ballot is asking residents to choose between three options for the future of their estate; 

1. Full redevelopment
2. Partial redevelopment
3. In-fill

The ballot is set to go ahead [despite the face-to-face consultation sessions being cancelled due to the Coronavirus](https://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/lgnl/council_and_democracy/consultations/Housing-consultations/HAP_Houses.aspx):
