title: JULY NEWS ROUND-UP

Thanks to all those who have taken the time to get in touch or leave a comment on the __Estate Watch__ website telling us what's going on with their estates. Here's our monthly round-up of July's estate regeneration news.

## Alton estate - uncertainty looms as result of Covid-19 pandemic 

A cloud of uncertainty has loomed over Wandsworth's regeneration of the Alton estate, since its development partner Redrow [announced](https://www.investegate.co.uk/redrow-plc--rdw-/rns/trading-statement/202006300700044407R/) that it was scaling back all but one of its London developments (the Colindale Gardens scheme) as a consequence of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.

At July's [full Council meeting](https://democracy.wandsworth.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=296&MId=6910&Ver=4) Wandsworth's Cabinet member confirmed Redrow's decision but provided little in the way of what discussions have taken place.

This follows Southwark's [recent decision](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/housing-chief-denies-aylesbury-estate-deal-is-bail-out-for-notting-hill-genesis/) to step in and stump up £193m to help its development partner complete the first phase of the Aylesbury estate redevelopment.

With the impacts of Covid-19 and Brexit, uncertainty is likely to become a recurring element within London's pipeline of estate demolition schemes, which are highly dependent on the cross-subsidy model. Progressive boroughs will now be looking increasingly to [refurbishment as a more viable and cost effective](https://estatewatch.london/refurbishment/) alternative.

## Lancaster West estate refurbishment - sustainability webinar
Some London boroughs have already understood the benefits of refurbishment. At the beginning of July, the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea hosted a webinar explore the feasibility of improving the energy efficiency by the refurbishment of its Lancaster West Estate.

The webinar gave an introduction to sustainability, and the net-zero opportunities for Lancaster West, with an expert panel including Professor Anne Power (London School of Economics), Lizzy Westmacott (ECD Architects), and James Traynor (ECD Architects and author of “EnerPhit: A Step by Step Guide to Low Energy Retrofit).

The Lancaster West refurbishment was funded by RBKC and the GLA - we hope to see a lot more such schemes in the pipeline now that the benefits of refurbishment are becoming more widely acknowledged. 

## Hackney runs 'pilot' ballot on De Beauvoir estate
Hackney Council has announced a 'pilot' ballot for residents on its [regeneration of the De Beauvoir estate](https://hackney.gov.uk/de-beauvoir-estate). Whilst the scheme is mainly in-fill development, six council homes and a row of shops are earmarked for demolition.

Hackney [says](http://mginternet.hackney.gov.uk/documents/s70551/200720%20ReportTrinity%20Court%20Pilot%20Ballot.pdf) that this 'pilot' ballot will help inform its policy on resident ballots for future regeneration projects, which is due to be presented to Cabinet in early Autumn.

## Estate Watch Zoom meeting
On 5th August, we are hosting a zoom meeting to provide an opportunity for residents of estates going through estate regeneration and who are at risk of demolition to come together to share and exchange with others in the same situation. We will also explore possible ongoing mutual support and effective working together.

Please keep these valuable community contributions coming - without your help there is no way of keeping tabs on the scale of London's estate demolitions. Please get in touch if we have missed an estate near you or if you have any other info on estate demolitions: info@estatewatch.london

## Research
We have updated our [research section](https://estatewatch.london/research/) of the website with a new research paper exploring the impacts of estate demolitions.

Professor Loretta Lees (Leicester University) and Professor Phil Hubbard (Kings College London) have published a policy briefing paper for the [UK Collaborative Centre for Housing Evidence](https://housingevidence.ac.uk/). 

The briefing uses qualitative methods to explore the impacts of decanting on different resident groups affected by estate regeneration.
