The festive season is approaching and Christmas is a great time for submitting controversial planning applications, limiting feedback as residents are less able to respond. Planning applications have just been submitted for no less than four of our estates under threat. We'll be exploring them further as we find out more but here's a brief summary based on the documents submitted to date.


## Cressingham Gardens
Lambeth Council (or rather its [SPV - 'Homes for Lambeth'](https://www.homesforlambeth.co.uk/)) has applied for permission to demolish 12 family homes in two maisonette blocks on the South-east corner of the Cressingham Gardens estate.

The [planning statement](https://planning.lambeth.gov.uk/online-applications/files/83BAE4274987382EE947282499316D28/pdf/20_02406_RG3-REVISED_PLANNING_STATEMENT-2579279.pdf) (prepared by Savills) explains that 20 new homes will be built of which 14 will be 'Council level' rent and the remaining 6 shared ownership.

Supporting docs for the planning application are available on Lambeth's planning portal [here](https://planning.lambeth.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=QDRW4MBOGMR00).

There appears to be no viability assessment submitted with this scheme, despite the Mayor's [policy requirement](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/intend_to_publish_-_clean.pdf) for applications to be accompanied by a viability assessment showing that the maximum amount of affordable housing is being provided.

## Cambridge Road estate
A planning application has been submitted for the demolition and redevelopment of Kingston's [Cambridge Road estate](https://estatewatch.london/estates/kingston/cambridgeroad/.

The application, submitted by Kingston's development partner [Countryside Properties](https://www.countrysideproperties.com/) seeks approval for demolition of the existing 832 homes and their replacement by 2,170 homes of which just 33.5% affordable housing.

This is in clear breach of the Council's own policy and Mayor's policy which requires 50% affordable housing on public land. 

Regeneration will take place over a period of 10-15 years in 5 phases.
33.5% affordable housing - below the 50% required by the Mayor..

Demolition of existing 832 homes
2,170 new homes plus 452
767 new social rented homes, 531 of which 1 and 2-beds.

Existing gas boilers will be replaced by new gas boilers
Despite Norbiton train station being located just 400m to the north of the estate and having one of the highest PTALs (Public Transport Accessibility Levels),  
848 994 new parking spaces.


80M in leaseholder buyback costs
11.2M in planning costs
130M for the social rented units of which 60M grant funding.
29M for the shared equity units for leaseholders

250M / 832 = more than 300k per home..


The [New London Plan (Policy SI7)]() requires major planning applications to provide a 'Circular Economy Statement' to demonstrate how circular economy principles have been accommodated through the scheme.

1.8M in carbon offset because the new homes won't be as energy efficient as the Mayor's zero carbon planning policies require. 

The planning application's [Energy Statement](https://publicaccess.kingston.gov.uk/online-applications/files/7E2224EA3ACA29219051C7CA067126FF/pdf/20_02942_FUL-CRE_-_ENERGY_STATEMENT_PART_1-4584307.pdf) acknowledges that the development will result in over 55,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions but

## Common thread - no alternatives
There is a common thread throughout these four planning applications; they all fail to meet the Mayor's requirement to explore alternatives. The requirement for the demolition of Council estates to be considered as a last resort, is enshrined both in the Mayor's [Estate Regeneration Guidance](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/better-homes-for-local-people-the-mayors-good-practice-guide-to-estate-regeneration.pdf) and the [London Plan itself](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/intend_to_publish_-_clean.pdf):

The Mayor's [new London Plan](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/intend_to_publish_-_clean.pdf) (Policy SI7 - Reducingwaste and supporting the circular economy) requires planning applications to be accompanied by a Circular Economy Statement showing how circular economy principles have been applied. One of the Mayor's [circular economy principles](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/design_for_a_circular_economy_web.pdf) is refurbishment whereever possible: 

<img src="/images/circular.png" class="img-fluid rounded img-thumbnail">

The Mayor has the power to 'call-in' all of these applications so this will be a test of his whether he intends for his circular economy principles to apply in practice and his resolve to ensure that demolition is always weighed against the significant [environmental, social and economic benefits of refurbishment](http://estatewatch.london/refurbishment).



## Estate Watch Zoom meeting
September's Estate Watch zoom meeting was well attended, with representatives from around a dozen estates under threat sharing their experiences. 

The date of the next Zoom meeting is yet to be confirmed.

Please email info@londontenants.org to request attendance and further 
details.
