## Cambridge Road estate
A planning application has been submitted for the demolition and redevelopment of Kingston's [Cambridge Road estate](https://estatewatch.london/estates/kingston/cambridgeroad/.

The application, submitted by Kingston's development partner [Countryside Properties](https://www.countrysideproperties.com/) seeks approval for demolition of the existing 832 homes and their replacement by 2,170 homes of which just 33.5% affordable housing.

This is in clear breach of the Council's own policy and Mayor's policy which requires 50% affordable housing on public land. 

Regeneration will take place over a period of 10-15 years in 5 phases.
33.5% affordable housing - below the 50% required by the Mayor..

Demolition of existing 832 homes
2,170 new homes plus 452
767 new social rented homes, 531 of which 1 and 2-beds.

Existing gas boilers will be replaced by new gas boilers
Despite Norbiton train station being located just 400m to the north of the estate and having one of the highest PTALs (Public Transport Accessibility Levels),  
848 994 new parking spaces.


80M in leaseholder buyback costs
11.2M in planning costs
130M for the social rented units of which 60M grant funding.
29M for the shared equity units for leaseholders

250M / 832 = more than 300k per home..


The [New London Plan (Policy SI7)]() requires major planning applications to provide a 'Circular Economy Statement' to demonstrate how circular economy principles have been accommodated through the scheme.

1.8M in carbon offset because the new homes won't be as energy efficient as the Mayor's zero carbon planning policies require. 

The planning application's [Energy Statement](https://publicaccess.kingston.gov.uk/online-applications/files/7E2224EA3ACA29219051C7CA067126FF/pdf/20_02942_FUL-CRE_-_ENERGY_STATEMENT_PART_1-4584307.pdf) acknowledges that the development will result in over 55,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions but
