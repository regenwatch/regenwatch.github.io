title: Estate regeneration ballots
---
Following a string of high-profile schemes where estates were regenerated against the wishes of its residents, in 201x Mayor Sadiq Khan introduced a requirement for residents to be balloted before estate regeneration could proceed. But when he introduced this policy, he exempted a large number of schemes from meeting the ballot requirement []() and introduced a further list of exemptions []().

In addition, council's and developers have come up with a number of inventive ways of getting round the ballot requirement:

1. Council's and developers are avoiding applying for funding to evade the ballot requirement (cf. Winstanley/Ebury Bridge estates etc).
2. Residents not being given a 'do nothing' option on the ballot paper (cf. Teviot estate).
3. Residents being told that if they vote against regeneration then their estate won't be maintained (cf. St Raphael's estate)
4. Sadiq Khan ignoring the ballot requirement altogether (cf. Grange Farm estate)
