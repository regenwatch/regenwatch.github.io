# The case for refurbishment

Often when appraisals are undertaken to evaluate estate redevelopment, a number of crucial factors are not taken into account:

2. The loss of rental income for the Council both in the short term and long term.
3. The social cost of decants on the housing waiting list and temporary accommodation costs.
4. The environmental cost of discarding thousands of tonnes of embodied carbon and generating thousands of tonnes of new uneccessary carbon emissions in the new-build construction.

[This case study](/images/genslerheygate.pdf) by Gensler architects shows how the refurbishment of the Heygate estate could have saved 40,000 tonnes of carbon emissions:

The Mayor is in the process of introducing a [new Circular Economy policy](aterials are retained in use at their highest value for as long as possible and are then reused or recycled, leaving a minimum of residual waste.) requiring that _'materials are retained in use at their highest value for as long as possible and are then reused or recycled, leaving a minimum of residual waste.'_


## Running estates down (parked section)  
Regeneration is often preceeded (and subsequently justified) by a period of disinvestment.
