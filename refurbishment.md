# The case for refurbishment

Often when appraisals are undertaken to evaluate estate redevelopment, a number of crucial factors are not taken into account:

1. The financial cost of decanting the estate including buy-out costs of leaseholders.
2. The loss of rental income for the Council both in the short term and long term.
3. The social cost of decants on the housing waiting list and [increased temporary accommodation costs](/images/temporaryspend.pdf).
4. The environmental cost of discarding thousands of tonnes of embodied carbon and generating thousands of tonnes of new uneccessary carbon emissions in the new-build construction.

[This case study](/images/genslerheygate.pdf) by Gensler architects shows how the refurbishment of the Heygate estate could have saved 40,000 tonnes of carbon emissions:

The [refurbishment of the Six Acres estate](/images/sixacres.pdf) in Islington serves as an example of what can be achieved. The estate is build with the same system as both the Heygate and Aylesbury estates.

A [further report](http://www.engineering.ucl.ac.uk/engineering-exchange/files/2014/10/Report-Refurbishment-Demolition-Social-Housing.pdf) by University College London (UCL Engineeering Exchange) says that.. They have also published [this factsheet](https://londontenants.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Fact-Sheet-Health-and-Wellbeing-Social-Housing.pdf) explaining the impacts of refurbishment vs demolition on wellbeing.

The Architects Journal is running a campaign to show how refurbishment is almost always better than redevelopment using a number of case studies as examples: [https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/retrofirst](https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/retrofirst)

## Circular Economy Policy
The Mayor is in the process of introducing a [new Circular Economy policy](aterials are retained in use at their highest value for as long as possible and are then reused or recycled, leaving a minimum of residual waste.) requiring that _'materials are retained in use at their highest value for as long as possible and are then reused or recycled, leaving a minimum of residual waste.'_


## Running estates down (parked section)  
Regeneration is often preceeded (and subsequently justified) by a period of disinvestment.
