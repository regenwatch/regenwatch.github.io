title: List of schemes that don't comply with the Mayor's new policies for estate regeneration
---
The Mayor has sought to redress such impacts by introducing <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/better-homes-for-local-people-the-mayors-good-practice-guide-to-estate-regeneration.pdf">new policies</a> requiring:
      <ul><b>
		      <li>1. At least 50% affordable housing with no net loss of social rent.</li>
		      <li>2. A full ballot of residents before proceeding with demolition.</li>
		      <li>3. A right to return to the estate for leaseholders and freeholders.</li>
      </ul>
     </b>

But the Mayor is turning a blind eye to <a href="/nameandshame.html">an increasing number of schemes</a> which fail to meet these requirements. We call on the Mayor to 'call in' these schemes and ensure they comply with his policies.
