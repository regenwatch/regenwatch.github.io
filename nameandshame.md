## Cambridge Road estate, Kingston
The [rehousing offer](https://cambridgeroadestate.com/assets/pdf/Cambridge_Road_Document_V6.pdf) to leaseholders at the Cambridge road estate regeneration requires them to take out a mortgage in order to benefit from the shared equity option on a new home at the redeveloped estate.

This is a breach of the Compulsory Purchase Code, which requires that residents are rehoused on redeveloped land at no financial cost to themselves[^1].
