title: Schemes failing to comply with the Mayor's new policies for estate regeneration
---
In response to pressure resulting from a numbe of high-profile and controversial estate regeneration schemes, In 2018 the Mayor introduced a number of <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/better-homes-for-local-people-the-mayors-good-practice-guide-to-estate-regeneration.pdf">new policy requirements</a> for estate regeneration:
		      
1. At least 50% affordable replacement housing with no net loss of social rent.
2. A full ballot of residents before proceeding with demolition.
3. A right to return to the estate for leaseholders and freeholders.

But the Mayor is turning a blind eye to an increasing number of schemes which fail to meet these requirements. We call on the Mayor to 'call in' these schemes and ensure they comply with his policies.
