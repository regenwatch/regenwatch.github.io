## Broken promises
During early consultation stages, residents are courted by council members, architects and consultants who will go to great lengths in an attempt to win support.

## Sleight of hand
Much of the replacement 'social' housing is provided as 'London Affordable Rent' which the mayor claims is similar to social rent levels. But the devil is in the detail - [this section 106 legal agreement](http://paplan.lbbd.gov.uk/online-applications/files/F07E42E8C4ADF9FDBF7F485D098282EA/pdf/17_00977_OUT-S106_AGREEMENT-272961.pdf) for the Gascoigne estate scheme in Barking & Dagenham, defines it loosely as anything up to 80% market rent:

## Viability
Many of the original promises to residents are broken because it emerges that they weren't financially viable at the outset. [Research](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/gla_migrate_files_destination/KnockItDownOrDoItUp_0.pdf) by the London Assembly gives several examples and explains what the usual consequences are.

_"For residents, the fallout often involves an extension to building-site life and the possibility of a reduction in the number of existing residents able to return to the rebuilt estate."_

## Tenants
Higher rents - LAR not regulated in same way as SR so starts off only marginally higher but greater rent increases over time. 

## Leaseholders
[Haringey's scheme](https://www.haringey.gov.uk/sites/haringeygovuk/files/estate_renewal_rehousing_and_payments_policy_2017.pdf) doesn't allow succession - you can't pass it on to your children, i.e. they will have to leave the house when you die. It also requires a minimum equity share of 60% and requires the leaseholder to take out another mortgage to replace their existing one.

Westmintster's scheme requires leaseholders to put their savings into the scheme.
