<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">The estates have been grouped into the following 3 categories to describe their current stage in the redevelopment process:</li>

  
<li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success"><h3>Proposal Stage</h3> The estate is included for "redevelopment" in a Local Plan.  There is no planning application yet.</li>

<li class="list-group-item list-group-item-warning"><h3>Preparation Stage</h3> The estate is going through the consultation stage.  It may be exempt from a ballot, or a ballot is pending or a ballot has taken place with residents voting in favour of demolition.</li>

<li class="list-group-item list-group-item-danger"><h3>Implementation Stage</h3> The "redevelopment" has planning permission.  The estate may be still occupied, with demolition pending, or a phased demolition may  be underway, with some parts of the estate still occupied.</li>
