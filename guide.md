## Sleight of hand
Much of the replacement 'social' housing is provided as 'London Affordable Rent' which the mayor claims is similar to social rent levels. But the devil is in the detail - [this section 106 legal agreement](http://paplan.lbbd.gov.uk/online-applications/files/F07E42E8C4ADF9FDBF7F485D098282EA/pdf/17_00977_OUT-S106_AGREEMENT-272961.pdf) for the Gascoigne estate scheme in Barking & Dagenham, defines it loosely as anything up to 80% market rent:

## Viability
Many of the original promises to residents are broken because it emerges that they weren't financially viable at the outset. [Research](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/gla_migrate_files_destination/KnockItDownOrDoItUp_0.pdf) by the London Assembly gives several examples and explains what the usual consequences are.

_"For residents, the fallout often involves an extension to building-site life and the possibility of a reduction in the number of existing residents able to return to the rebuilt estate."_

## Tenants
